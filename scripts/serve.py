"""Serve a local model and drop into a shell that opencode is already wired to.

    scripts/serve.py                 # pick a model, then land in a ready shell
    scripts/serve.py ornith-35b      # skip the picker
    scripts/serve.py --fresh         # ignore saved settings, ask everything
    scripts/serve.py --no-shell      # just run the server in the foreground

What the default path does
--------------------------
1. Asks which installed model to serve (numbered list) unless one was named.
2. Reuses your last settings - port, context, host - unless ``--fresh``.
3. Starts ``llama-server`` in the background.
4. Writes a session opencode config whose default model is the one you picked.
5. Execs an **interactive bash subshell** with ``OPENCODE_CONFIG`` exported.

So the whole workflow is::

    scripts/serve.py
    cd ~/some/project
    opencode

Everything is bash regardless of your login shell, so behaviour is identical
from fish, zsh or bash. The server is a child of that subshell and a trap kills
it on exit, so closing the terminal - or typing ``exit`` - stops both the model
and anything still talking to it. Nothing is left running in the background.

"""The three-arm conductor benchmark driver.

Three arms - plain opencode, opencode carrying the doctrine packs, and opencode
carrying the conductor plugin - run the same task set through the same router,
several times each. A cell is one (model, capability, arm, task, repetition)
point of that matrix. This module owns the manifest, the arm construction, the
run plan, one result file per cell, the run manifest that records the campaign's
own design, and the report. The live runs themselves are somebody else's job.

The tasks are a scope ladder: T0 stays inside the plugin's own triviality bound
and measures the cost floor, and each tier above it reaches further into the
process under test. That matters because a comparison runnable only on work
below the system's triviality threshold cannot answer whether the system helps.

The pure parts (manifest load, arm construction, run plan, ledger window,
scoring, aggregation, report) touch no process and no filesystem, which is what
makes them unit-testable offline. Everything that spawns or writes is a thin
layer over them and is injectable, so the suite drives the driver without ever
starting opencode, llama-server, llama-router or a model.

Scoring is the hidden test command's exit status, passed through. There is no
partial credit and nothing model-graded anywhere in this file. Beside it rides
a hand-scored rubric lane, which is the only thing here that reads a judgement,
and it is entered by a person rather than derived.

    naming a file the operator cannot find in any diff. The map this returns is
    the source the repository holds, which is the tree the model is handed.

    Bodies are text, and a file this cannot decode as UTF-8 is refused by name.
    The whole seeding path is text - the inline form is a JSON string,
    ``materialize_files`` writes with ``write_text``, and the result is
    committed - so a byte-exact binary file cannot survive it. Decoding it with
    a replacement character would hand the model a file that differs from the
    one the repository holds, in a way no test would report; a corpus that needs
    exact bytes states them in a text encoding its own tooling decodes.

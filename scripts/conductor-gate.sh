# Conductor build: mechanical stub scan (task gate M5). Orchestrator-owned.
# Scans committed conductor/TS and router/C++ sources for the G4-forbidden shapes the
# plan names but supplies no mechanism for. Covers: stub markers, skip/todo tests,
# trivially-true assertions, empty catch blocks. (New-source-not-imported-by-any-test
# is checked separately in verify-acceptance.sh; empty function bodies are checked by
# eyeball during the mandatory diff read - too idiom-dependent for a regex.)
# Usage: bash scripts/conductor-gate.sh [file ...]   (no args = all tracked sources)

  # this list did not follow), so each half now carries a floor. The floors are

  # phases described a set that contained none of the code the phase had just written.
  # Passing the files explicitly was the standing workaround, which is to say the scan
  # was correct only when someone remembered it was not.

# Placeholder/stub markers name unfinished PRODUCT, so — like the bare word "stub"
# below — they are scanned in production source only and allowed under conductor/tests/
# (C-013, C-026). In test files these same tokens appear legitimately as test DATA
# ("git grep TODO" fed to the shell-parser), as the SUBJECT of anti-stub enforcement
# (doctrine.test.ts's "placeholder marker"; the 15.1 doc-fidelity test), and in example
# strings (…conductor-quar-outside-XXXX/…). An UNFINISHED TEST — the real test-file risk
# — is caught independently and does NOT rely on this scan: test-conductor.sh hard-fails
# any skipped/todo test or SKIP/TODO TAP directive at any depth, and PAT_SKIP below still
# applies to tests. XXX is word-bounded so a real `XXX` marker still trips but a longer
# XXXX random-suffix token does not (C-026).
#
# These match marker SHAPES, not the words themselves. The bare-word version could not
# be run over the whole tree: conductor/core/planning.ts IS the placeholder detector and
# conductor/adapter/tools.ts writes the prompts that forbid stubbing, so a word-level
# scan flags the enforcement machinery as the violation and the no-argument mode becomes
# unusable — which is how the C++ half went unscanned without anyone noticing.
# The shapes below deliberately mirror the ones the PRODUCT pins for the same job at
# conductor/core/planning.ts:562-577. If you change one, change both: this is the
# one-rule-in-two-places pattern that has already drifted six times in this build.

# Line-level exemptions: `<path>|<scan>|<substring that must appear on the matched line>`.
# A few modules here are ABOUT unfinished-work markers, so a textual scan reads their
# subject matter as their content. The fingerprint fixtures are the newest case: they
# quote, verbatim, what a planner was thinking while deliberating over the doctrine's
# no-placeholder rule, and the anchors below are the hedges that make those two lines the
# corpus. Rewording them to dodge the scan would destroy the sample. The exemption is per LINE, not per file — any
# OTHER marker in the same file still fails — and every entry is verified to still match
# something below, so an exemption cannot quietly outlive the line it was written for.

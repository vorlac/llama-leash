"""Pure wiring functions shared by serve.py and fetch_models.py (plan:2866-2889).

Everything the conductor needs in order to launch llama-router, generate its
config, derive one slot count for both sides of the concurrency contract and
merge the conductor opencode fragment lives here rather than inside serve.py,
so it can be exercised without starting a server, opening a socket or spawning
a process. Nothing in this module performs a filesystem write; the two I/O
seams it does have - process spawn and health probe - are injectable.

This module must never import fetch_models: fetch_models imports THIS module,
and a cycle breaks `fetch_models.py config`. The two constants that would
otherwise be shared (PROVIDER_ID, the default llama-server port) are therefore
restated below and checked by the unittest against the configs both sides emit.

# MEASUREMENT SETTING — sub-session deadlines are effectively OFF.
#
# Every duration deadline below is six hours, which no roll on this rig can
# reach: the ceiling exists only so a number is present where the schema wants
# one, because "absent" and "expire immediately" are the same value on some
# paths and that is not a thing to discover during a run.
#
# WHY. A deadline can only be sized against a distribution somebody has
# observed, and this one has never been observed. 39% of planner dispatches were
# killed, and a killed roll never reveals how long it WOULD have taken — every
# figure in the calibration table below is a lower bound on a censored sample.
# Six sightings across this campaign show the killed session generating at the
# hardware's full rate and cut mid-sentence; none shows a deadline catching a
# pathology. The instrument was removing the measurement.
#
# WHAT STILL GUARDS THE RUN, because this is not "no timeouts":
#   - router/router.hpp kRelayTimeoutSeconds (600) is a PER-READ timeout, so a
#     session that genuinely stops emitting dies after 600s of silence. That is
#     a liveness signal, which is the correct shape - but it is NOT proof
#     against healthy work: in epoch 22 it fired twice, at upstreamMs 600001
#     and 600003, on a lens that a stale router config had over-admitted into
#     llama-server's internal queue (no slot, so no tokens, so 600s of
#     "silence" that was really a queue). The lens then succeeded in 353s once
#     a slot opened. A backstop that has fired on healthy work is a backstop
#     whose preconditions must hold, which is what the router-config preflight
#     in run_and_watch.start_services exists to guarantee.
#   - the cell's own tier budget remains as the single outer bound, and is the
#     only thing that stops a run looping in the FSM where every turn emits
#     tokens and the relay guard therefore never sees silence.
#
# Restoring a real deadline is the point of running this way: the tail becomes
# observable for the first time, and a number fitted to it will be a measurement
# rather than the guess this replaces.
# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

# is what the derivation multiplies back up.
#
# The window itself is sized by the 13.2 smoke (2026-08-21, llama-server build
# 10542): the orchestrator's FIRST request - the agent prompt, the injected
# doctrine and state block, the user prompt and 31 tool schemas - measured
# 11,441 tokens, and an 8192-token slot refused it outright. The slot has to hold

# measurement; six slots of 32768 loaded as a 34.1 GB child on the 64 GB host.
# Raised from 32768 against the measured KV rate below. At DEFAULT_MAX_READERS
# slots this is 393,216 cells x 64 KiB = 24.0 GiB of KV, which with 20.46 GiB of
# weights is the 44.7 GiB the host was measured holding — the same total the

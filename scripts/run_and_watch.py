"""Run a conductor benchmark and watch all three arms in one terminal.

    /usr/bin/python3 scripts/run_and_watch.py

No arguments. Every knob is a constant in the CONFIG block below, each one
documented with what it does and what happens if you change it. Edit the
constants; do not memorise flags.

WHAT IT DOES

Starts scripts/conductor_bench.py as a child process and, while it runs, prints
three feeds that would otherwise need three terminals:

  1. BENCH      the driver's own output, relayed line by line as it arrives.
  2. SCOREBOARD every arm's outcome, wall clock and token cost, read from the
                result JSON each cell writes the moment it finishes.
  3. CONDUCTOR  the live console for the conductor cell currently running:
                stall clock, per-turn table, refusals, sub-session traffic.

Feeds 1 and 2 cover all three arms. Feed 3 covers only the conductor arm, and
that is a fact about the arms rather than a gap in this script: baseline and
doctrine load no plugin, so they write no journal and there is nothing to read.
While those two run you will see the bench feed and nothing else, which is the
honest picture rather than an empty panel implying something is broken.

THE MODEL SERVER

It also brings the model up and takes it down. A run needs llama-server holding
the weights and llama-router in front of it; with AUTO_SERVE on, both are started
before the first cell and stopped after the last one, however the run ends —
finished, failed, or ctrl-C. Switching models is then one edit to MODEL, because
the old weights are released before the next run loads new ones.

It will not touch a server it did not start. If one is already answering, that
one is used and left running.

Ctrl-C stops the benchmark, prints a final scoreboard, and releases the weights.

# ── WHAT TO RUN ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# The task set. Each manifest is a self-contained collection of tasks with its
# own defaults. `bench/conductor-tasks.json` is the 23-task ladder that spans
# T0 through T4. The corpus sets are narrower and heavier:
#
#   bench/conductor-tasks.json   23 tasks, T0-T4, the general ladder
#   bench/corpus-euler.json      20 tasks, Project Euler, mostly T1
#   bench/corpus-systems.json     4 tasks, systems implementation
#   bench/corpus-repair.json      5 tasks, debugging and repair
#   bench/corpus-perf.json        3 tasks, performance work
#   bench/corpus-games.json       2 tasks, TUI games
MANIFEST = "bench/conductor-tasks.json"

# Which tasks to run, by id. EMPTY LIST MEANS EVERY TASK IN THE MANIFEST, which
# is the default and is what "run through all the prompts" means. Naming even
# one id here narrows the run to that id, which is what you want when you are
# chasing a single failure.
#
#   TASKS = []                    every task
#   TASKS = ["euler-001-py"]      one task (also set MANIFEST to its set)
TASKS: List[str] = ["slugify-ts", "euler-cli-py", "logfmt-lenses-ts", "clock-inject-py"]

# Which tiers to run. Empty means every tier present in the manifest. Tiers are
# a wall-clock budget per cell, not a difficulty rating: T0 1800s, T1 2700s,
# T2 3600s, T3 7200s, T4 3600s. Combining TASKS and TIERS intersects them.
TIERS: List[str] = []

# Repetitions of each (arm, task) pair. ONE is right for watching a run and for
# chasing a specific failure. THREE is the driver's own default and is the floor
# for saying anything about variance — a single repetition cannot separate a
# real spread from noise, and the generated report says so about itself.
#
# Total cells = 3 arms x tasks x REPS. Every cell is one opencode process
# against one throwaway git repo, so this number multiplies the whole run.
REPS = 1

# Extra baseline repetitions per task, placed beside the sweep they calibrate.
# Not scoreboard cells: they measure THIS epoch's noise floor. Epoch 12 and 13
# ran the same baseline cell at 6,364 and 614 generated tokens — a 10x swing on
# an arm no change in this campaign can reach — so a cross-epoch difference in
# another arm cannot be told from sampling without one. Baseline is the cheapest
# arm, so three samples per task cost minutes and cannot alter what they measure.
CALIBRATION_REPS: int = 2

# The model. None means the manifest's own `defaults.model`, which for every set
# in this repository is llamacpp/qwen3.8-27b. Set a string to run a different
# one; the provider prefix is optional, so "qwen3.6-27b" and
# "llamacpp/qwen3.6-27b" both work.
#
# Whatever you name has to be on disk under .data/models. Today that is:
#   qwen3.8-27b   qwen3.6-27b   qwen3.6-35b-a3b
#   qwen3-coder-30b   qwen3-coder-next   ornith-9b   embeddinggemma-300m
#
# With AUTO_SERVE on, changing this line is the whole of switching models: the

#
#   baseline    stock opencode `build` agent. No plugin, no doctrine.
#   doctrine    same agent, all nine doctrine packs as a static system prompt.

# ── WHERE THINGS GO ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# Where each cell's scored result JSON is written.
#
# THIS IS THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL SETTING IN THE FILE. The driver treats an
# existing result file as a finished cell: it reuses that JSON and DOES NOT
# CREATE THE WORK TREE. Point two runs at one directory and the second silently
# skips everything the first completed. That is a good property for resuming a
# 200-cell overnight and a trap for a comparison you intend to watch — an
# earlier run of ours reported three arms while only one had actually executed.
#
# The default mints a fresh timestamped directory every launch, so nothing is
# ever reused by accident. Set a fixed path to opt into resume.
#
#   RESULTS_DIR = None                              fresh, timestamped
#   RESULTS_DIR = ".data/benchmark/my-campaign"     fixed; resumes
RESULTS_DIR: Optional[str] = None

# Where each cell's throwaway git repo is built. None means the driver's
# default, $TMPDIR/llama-leash-conductor-work. The layout underneath is
# <work root>/<model>/<capability>/<arm>/<task>/rN/ and each of those holds
# repo/ (what the model edits), repo/.conductor/ (run state, which feed 3
# reads), home/ (a hermetic XDG home) and opencode.log (that cell's own log).
#
# Keep it OUT of this repository: a work tree inside the repo would put a git
# checkout inside a git checkout.
#
# It is ALSO kept out of $TMPDIR, which is the default and is where a cell was
# lost. macOS hands each user a $TMPDIR like
# /var/folders/6h/1x7gzts90yqfbtlkjn24_qkh0000gn/T/ — long, randomly named, and
# reached through a symlink. Building a work tree under it, opencode composed
# the permission pattern for `src/solvers/*` from a copy of that path with eight
# characters missing out of the random component, found the result outside the
# project, and refused the arm a file in its own repository. The arm read three
# files, was denied the fourth, and stopped with an empty diff.
#
# A short, stable, real directory avoids the whole class. `~` is not a symlink
# and its path is a fifth the length.
WORK_ROOT: Optional[str] = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser("~"), ".llama-leash-work")

# ── THE MODEL SERVER ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# Start the model server for the run, and stop it again when the run ends.
#
# A run needs two processes up: llama-server holding the weights, and
# llama-router in front of it, which is the address every arm's requests go
# through so token accounting is identical across arms. With this on, both are
# started before the first cell and torn down after the last one.
#
# IT WILL NOT TOUCH A SERVER IT DID NOT START. If something is already answering
# on the upstream port, that server is used as it stands and left running when
# the run ends — a session you started by hand for something else does not get
# reaped because a benchmark happened to finish.
#
# Turn this off to manage the server yourself, in which case the preflight still
# checks it is up and refuses to start a run that cannot reach it.
AUTO_SERVE = True

# How long to wait for the weights to load before giving up. A 27B model off a
# cold page cache is minutes, not seconds, and the wait is mostly disk.
SERVE_READY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 600

# Hold system sleep off while the run is in progress.
#
# A benchmark is a long stretch of a machine sitting at a prompt waiting for a
# local model, which looks exactly like an idle machine. When this Mac slept
# mid-run it broke the measurement three separate ways: the cell budget is
# counted down on a clock that stops during sleep while the recorded elapsed was
# wall time, so a 60-minute cell was recorded at 86.8 minutes and never tripped
# its own timeout; a cell woke to find the model unreachable, spent zero tokens
# and was scored a failure against its arm; and every wall clock in the run
# silently included time nothing was running.
#
# `caffeinate -is` asserts "no idle sleep" and "no system sleep" for as long as
# the process it wraps lives, so the assertion is released when the run ends
# however it ends. Display sleep is deliberately left alone: the screen may go
# dark, the machine may not.
PREVENT_SLEEP = True

# The served window, as slots x tokens-per-slot.
#
# THESE TWO NUMBERS DECIDE HOW MUCH ROOM AN ARM HAS TO THINK IN, and they are
# not interchangeable with each other. llama-server divides --ctx-size among its
# slots, so the total KV cache is SERVE_SLOTS x SERVE_PER_SLOT_CONTEXT and the
# window any one sub-session actually gets is SERVE_PER_SLOT_CONTEXT alone.
#
# The per-slot window is not free space. opencode compacts a session once it
# reaches `context - output reserve`, and the arms do not start from the same
# place: the doctrine arm's static prompt is ~13.8k tokens on EVERY request, and
# the conductor's tool schemas are on the same order. At 32,768 per slot that
# left the doctrine arm about 10k of working room, and it spent a whole T0 cell
# compacting, re-deriving the same next step, and compacting again — three times
# — while holding a correct answer. That is context pressure being measured
# instead of doctrine.
#
# Slots are what the conductor's fan-out consumes: it dispatches its reviewers
# concurrently, so a slot count below that fan-out serializes them and shows up
# as wall clock rather than as a refusal. Three is the observed reviewer wave.
#
# The product is the memory. 3 x 65536 is the same 196,608 total as the 6 x
# 32768 it replaces, so the window doubles at no cost in KV cache. Raise the
# product only if the machine has the memory to hold it.

# is the reason to be looking. Trimming eats the oldest turn rows first, and on
# a very long run it will reach the refusals block; the header's `refusals N`
# count still tells you they happened. Set 0 to show everything.

# against a 45-minute T1 budget. Only the conductor arm has ever actually
# reached a ceiling. Read the printed figure as "this cannot take longer than",

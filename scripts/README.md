# Local model harness

`fetch_models.py` downloads, assembles and validates open-weight GGUF models,
then wires every installed model into opencode through a single llama.cpp
router server.

Standard library only — Python 3.9+, no virtualenv required. The repository's test gate
pins the system interpreter, `/usr/bin/python3`, so no `.py` file here may depend on a
Homebrew or pyenv Python.

```bash
/usr/bin/python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts -p 'test_*.py'
```

That discovers `test_conductor_wiring.py` (the router-wiring functions `serve.py` and
`fetch_models.py` share) and `test_conductor_bench.py` (the three-arm benchmark
driver). Both are pure: they start no server, open no socket and write nothing under
`.data/`. `bash scripts/test-conductor.sh` runs the same command as its final leg.

The one optional extra is [`rich`](https://rich.readthedocs.io), which upgrades
the benchmark's output to live progress bars and colour-coded tables. Without it
everything still runs and prints aligned plain text:

```bash
pip3 install --user rich
```

`setup.sh` offers to install it.

```

  scripts/              generated helpers (launch.sh)
  configs/              opencode.json, llama-models.ini, benchmark.json,
                        serve-session.json (remembered serve settings),
                        opencode.session.json (this session's config),
                        conductor-router.json + router.log (llama-router)
  router/               metrics.jsonl, the router's request ledger
  benchmark/            results + report.md
```

`.data/` is entirely disposable: delete it and re-run `install` to rebuild. It is not
the only ignored directory — `.out/` (the CMake build trees) and
`conductor/node_modules/` are ignored too, and are equally disposable.

`ui.py`, `models_catalog.py`, `bench_presets.py` and `conductor_wiring.py` are imported
modules with no command line of their own. `hostinfo.py` is normally imported too, but
running it directly prints the measured host profile and its JSON. The four shell
scripts belong to the conductor harness rather than the model harness.
`test-conductor.sh` is the canonical gate and `conductor/docs/OPERATIONS.md` records the
verdict it must print; `conductor-gate.sh` and `verify-acceptance.sh` are the stub scan
and the acceptance checklist.

## Quick start

```bash
scripts/fetch_models.py list                 # catalog + what fits this machine
scripts/fetch_models.py install ornith-35b   # download, validate, reconfigure
scripts/fetch_models.py build                # build llama-* from the submodule
scripts/fetch_models.py serve                # start the llama.cpp router
```

Then, in another shell:

```bash
OPENCODE_CONFIG=$PWD/.data/configs/opencode.json opencode
```

Or do both in one step — `scripts/serve.py` starts the server (and `llama-router`, if
it is built) and drops you into a shell where `OPENCODE_CONFIG` is already set:

```bash
scripts/serve.py                             # pick a model interactively
scripts/serve.py ornith-35b                  # skip the picker
```

Every installed model shows up in opencode's model picker. Switching models in
the TUI transparently swaps which weights are resident.

---

## How serving works

`scripts/serve.py` is the normal entry point; the detail below is what it sets
up for you.

All models are served by **one** `llama-server` process in *router mode* — llama.cpp's
own term for a parent process that spawns a child server per model and proxies to it:

```
llama-server --models-preset .data/configs/llama-models.ini \
    --models-max 1 --models-autoload \
    --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080 --jinja \
    --parallel 6 --ctx-size 49152
```

The parent reads the generated INI, publishes every model at `/v1/models`, and
loads/unloads weights on demand as requests come in. `--models-max 1` means only
one model is resident at a time — essential when a single model can occupy 30 GB+
of a 64 GB machine. Raise it only for combinations that genuinely fit side by
side (e.g. a 12 GB coder plus a 0.3 GB embedder):

```bash
scripts/fetch_models.py config --models-max 2
```

`.data/configs/opencode.json` talks to that one endpoint via
`@ai-sdk/openai-compatible`, so llama.cpp is the only path between opencode and
any model.

### Slots and context

`--parallel N` gives llama-server N concurrent request slots, and `--ctx-size` is the
**total** context divided among them — not the per-slot window. Passing `--parallel 6`
without raising `--ctx-size` would silently cut every slot to a sixth of the intended
window, so `serve.py` derives both from one number:

```
slots      = max(1, --max-readers)      # default 6
--parallel = slots
--ctx-size = 8192 * slots               # 49152 at the default
```

`--ctx N` overrides the per-slot window, not the total, so `--ctx 16384 --max-readers 6`
asks for `--ctx-size 98304`. At one slot there is nothing to divide and no `--ctx-size`
is emitted unless `--ctx` asked for one.

### llama-router

`llama-router` is this repository's own C++ proxy (built from `router/`), and it is a
different thing from llama-server's preset router mode. When the binary is present,
`serve.py` starts it in front of llama-server and points opencode at it instead; it
adds per-model admission control, priority queueing and a request ledger, and it
forwards `/v1/*` otherwise untouched. Build it with:

```bash
cmake --preset clang-relwdebinfo
cmake --build .out/build/clang-relwdebinfo --target llama-router
```

The router also needs its config schema, which is generated rather than committed:

```bash
node conductor/tools/export-schemas.ts router/tests/schemas
```

`serve.py` looks for the binary at `$LLAMA_ROUTER`, then under
`.out/build/{clang-relwdebinfo,clang-release,clang-debug}/`, then `.data/tools/`, then
on `$PATH`. With no binary, or no schema, the session talks to llama-server directly and
says which of the two is missing; `--router` turns that quiet fallback into a refusal
that names the remedy. `--router` cannot be combined with `--no-shell`, because
`--no-shell` leaves no session process to supervise the router.

The router's own config is `.data/configs/conductor-router.json`. `serve.py` refreshes
only the machine-derived keys in it — the listen and upstream addresses, the version,
`admission.maxInflightPerModel` and the ledger path — so every other key survives
regeneration as a hand edit. `--fresh` discards those edits.

| `--print-env`              | print the session environment and exit; starts and writes nothing     |
| `--include-utility`        | also offer embedding/reranker models in the picker                    |
| `--no-build-check`         | skip verifying `.data/tools/` against the submodule                   |

A session shell exports `LLAMA_HARNESS_MODEL`, `LLAMA_HARNESS_URL`,
`LLAMA_HARNESS_SERVER_PID`, `LLAMA_HARNESS_ROUTER` (`1`/`0`), and — with the router up
— `LLAMA_HARNESS_ROUTER_URL` and `LLAMA_HARNESS_ROUTER_CONFIG`, alongside
`OPENCODE_CONFIG`.

## Sizing: what actually fits in 64 GB

This is an **Apple M4 Max with 64 GiB (68.7 GB) of unified memory**. Two things
make the usable number smaller than the sticker number:

1. **macOS caps Metal at ~75% of RAM** by default → about **52 GB** for weights.
2. **KV cache and compute buffers** are on top of the weights, and grow with
   context length. The tool reserves 18% as headroom — never less than 6 GB — and
   calls the remainder *comfortable*.

So the practical tiers are:

| label     | meaning                                                                         |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fits`    | weights + headroom fit inside the Metal budget                                  |
| `tight`   | weights fit, but headroom is thin — reduce `ctx-size`, or raise the wired limit |
| `too big` | will not load                                                                   |

To use more than the default 75%, raise the wired limit (resets on reboot):

```bash
sudo sysctl iogpu.wired_limit_mb=57344   # 56 GB
```

`fetch_models.py list` reads that sysctl and recalculates automatically. This is
what makes `qwen3-coder-next` (48 GB) viable.

Sizes throughout are **decimal GB**, matching HuggingFace. 64 GiB = 68.7 GB.

## Model catalog

⚠️ = experimental: exotic quant formats or very new architectures that may need a
newer llama.cpp than the pinned submodule. Excluded from `--all` and `--category`.

**Where to start.** `ornith-35b` is the strongest all-round agentic coder that
fits comfortably — MIT licensed, SOTA for its size on Terminal-Bench 2.1 and
SWE-Bench. `qwen3-coder-30b` is the fast daily driver (3B active params).
`ornith-9b` and `gpt-oss-20b` are quick enough for tight edit/test loops.

`qwen3-coder-next` is the most capable coder here but needs the raised wired
limit; `laguna-s-2.1` only fits at sub-4-bit, which materially degrades it.

For the adversarial-review workflow you described, pair models from *different
families* — e.g. `ornith-35b` writing and `kat-coder-v2.5` or `qwen3.6-27b`
reviewing. Two checkpoints from the same family tend to share blind spots.

`olmo-3.1-32b-think` is the only model here with fully auditable provenance —
open weights, data *and* training code.

**A note on the writing category.** These are general models chosen for prose
quality, not "creative writing" finetunes. The finetune scene for writing is
dominated by unaudited community merges with unclear provenance and licensing,
which is a poor fit for a reproducible setup. The Gemma line is the strongest
local option for natural prose — READMEs, design docs, commit messages.
`gemma-4-26b-a4b` gives near-31B quality at 4B-active speed.

**These understand images; they do not generate them.** llama.cpp is a text/LLM
runtime — image *generation* is a different stack (`stable-diffusion.cpp`,
ComfyUI) and is out of scope for this script. What these give you is critique and
analysis: reading design mockups and UI screenshots, describing composition,
writing and refining prompts for an external image generator.

Vision requires a projector: add `--with-mmproj`.

```bash
scripts/fetch_models.py install qwen3-vl-30b --with-mmproj
```

Without it the model loads as text-only, and the generated `opencode.json`
honestly reports `attachment: false` for it.

`ternary-bonsai-27b` is natively ternary-trained — a 27B multimodal model in
7.2 GB, which is a genuinely different thing from a 27B crushed to 2 bits. It
uses non-standard quant types (`Q2_0`/`PQ2_0`); verify llama.cpp support before
relying on it.

These are served by the router but deliberately **not** offered as opencode agent
models — they are not chat models. They are here for the retrieval side of the
harness you plan to build.

## What "validate" actually checks

Downloads are not trusted. Every install verifies, in order:

1. **Exact byte size** against the HuggingFace file tree.
2. **SHA-256** against the LFS `oid` published by HuggingFace — the authoritative
   content hash, not a size heuristic.
3. **GGUF magic and version**, by parsing the header.
4. **Shard-count consistency** — the `split.count` field inside the GGUF metadata
   must match the number of files actually downloaded.

Architecture, tensor count and context length are read out of the GGUF metadata
and recorded in `.data/models/<id>/.manifest.json` alongside the file hashes.

Downloads are resumable at 32 MB chunk granularity. Interrupt an install at any
point and re-run it — completed chunks are tracked in a sidecar and skipped.

Re-check everything at any time:

```bash
scripts/fetch_models.py verify
```

---

## Tools: always built, always current

`scripts/fetch_models.py build` compiles every binary the harness needs from
`extern/llama-cpp` into `.data/tools/`:

`llama-server` `llama-bench` `llama-perplexity` `llama-cli` `llama-mtmd-cli`
`llama-tts` `llama-batched-bench` `llama-tokenize` `llama-quantize`

The build records the submodule commit it came from in
`.data/tools/.build-stamp.json`. Every `serve` and every `benchmark` run
re-checks that stamp against `git -C extern/llama-cpp rev-parse HEAD` and
rebuilds automatically if the submodule has moved or the cmake flags changed, so
the tools can never silently drift from the pinned llama.cpp.

```bash
scripts/fetch_models.py build            # build if stale (a no-op when current)
scripts/fetch_models.py build --force    # rebuild unconditionally
scripts/fetch_models.py status           # shows the tool state
```

---

## Benchmarking

Install `rich` first for live progress and colour-coded tables (optional):

```bash
pip3 install --user rich
```

```bash
scripts/benchmark.py --dry-run        # plan + time estimate, runs nothing
scripts/benchmark.py                  # every enabled model
scripts/benchmark.py --model ornith-35b   # repeatable
scripts/benchmark.py --resume         # skip cells that already have a result.json
scripts/benchmark.py --report-only    # rebuild the report from existing results
scripts/benchmark.py --config PATH    # an alternate benchmark config
scripts/benchmark.py --quick-host     # skip the host throughput measurement
scripts/benchmark.py --no-build-check # do not verify tools against the submodule
```

Everything else is configured in `.data/configs/benchmark.json`, regenerated by
`fetch_models.py config` so it always lists exactly what is installed. Set
`enabled: false` to skip a model; trim `presets` to shorten a run. The runner starts
its own `llama-server` on port 8199 (`$BENCH_PORT`), so it does not disturb a session.

### Presets, not parameter sweeps

A cross-product of sampling values mostly produces noise. Instead there are ten
named presets, each answering one question, drawn from what model authors publish
and what the Apple-Silicon community has settled on:

| preset             | question it answers                                        |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `author-default`   | the model author's own published settings — the control    |
| `deterministic`    | greedy decoding, the standard for code and reproducibility |
| `metal-throughput` | flash-attn on + large ubatch — peak tok/s on M-series      |
| `flash-attn-off`   | what is flash attention actually worth here?               |
| `kv-q8`            | is the "8-bit KV is free" consensus true on real output?   |
| `kv-q4`            | how much quality does a 4-bit KV cache actually cost?      |
| `long-context`     | 4x context + q8 KV — degradation as context grows          |
| `balanced-chat`    | temp 0.7 / top-p 0.8 — the general-purpose middle ground   |
| `min-p`            | does min-p beat top-p for coherence at equal diversity?    |
| `high-creative`    | temp 1.0 / top-p 0.95 — helps prose, expected to hurt code |

Presets split into **runtime** flags (fixed at load time — changing one forces a
model reload) and **sampling** flags (per request, free). The runner groups by
runtime signature so each distinct runtime config is loaded exactly once and all
its sampling variants run against that single load. Generation goes through
`llama-server`'s HTTP API rather than `llama-cli`, which would reload the model
for every single run.

### Tasks

One shared task per category, so models within a category compete on identical
work. Add or edit them in `bench_presets.py`.

| category | task                                      | scoring                                |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| coding   | merge overlapping integer ranges          | **executed** against 12 hidden tests   |
| general  | fix a subtly broken `median()`            | **executed** against 6 hidden tests    |
| writing  | document a `RateLimiter` class            | symbol coverage parsed from the source |
| vision   | describe + critique a generated bar chart | self-judge only                        |
| utility  | retrieval over a fixed probe set          | recall@1                               |
| audio    | TTS render                                | needs a `qwen3tts`/OuteTTS model       |

The coding problem is deliberately not a LeetCode classic — those are memorized
verbatim from training data, which measures recall rather than coding ability.

### Scoring tiers

1. **Objective** — generated code is *executed* against hidden tests; docs are
   checked against symbols parsed from the source; retrieval is recall@1. This is
   the only column to trust.
2. **Perplexity** — via `llama-perplexity`, objectively measuring how much a
   given quant / KV-cache config degrades the model. No judge involved.
3. **SELF-graded** — the model scoring **its own** output. This is *not* an
   independent quality measure and is never mixed into the objective score. Every
   surface labels it as self-graded.

The interesting number is **calibration**: `self_score − objective`. Positive
means the model over-rated itself; near zero means it can tell when it is wrong.

### Running more models than fit on disk

```jsonc
"eviction": { "delete_after_each": true }
```

Each model is benchmarked, then deleted before the next one, so a sweep can
cover more of the catalog than fits on disk at once. The plan is built from the
models installed under `.data/models/` when the sweep starts: install a batch,
run with eviction on, install the next batch, and continue with `--resume`,
which makes an interrupted multi-hour run pick up where it stopped.

### Host profile

Every run records the machine, measured rather than merely named: memory copy
bandwidth, disk sequential read, single-thread CPU throughput, GPU core count,
and the Metal wired limit. It also captures power source, low-power mode and
thermal pressure **before and after** the run — if the machine throttled partway
through, the report says so instead of quietly skewing the numbers.

Memory bandwidth is measured by [`tools/membench`](../tools/membench), which
`hostinfo.py` builds on demand. It reports both a single-threaded copy and the
multi-threaded peak. Both are CPU-side ceilings and still sit below the chip's
spec sheet, because that number assumes the GPU driving every channel at once. Read
them as context for the machine, not as a throughput prediction: the tok/s figures in
the report come from each request's own `timings` block, returned by `llama-server`
alongside the completion.

### Categories that cannot be benchmarked

- **music / beat generation** — nothing exists. llama.cpp has no music
  architecture, and the MusicGen GGUF repos target other runtimes. Speech
  synthesis *is* supported (`qwen3tts`, `wavtokenizer-dec`), which is what the
  audio task uses.
- **image generation** — llama.cpp cannot generate images. FLUX.1/FLUX.2, SD3.5
  and Qwen-Image all ship GGUF weights but run in `stable-diffusion.cpp`, a
  separate engine. Adding it as a second submodule would make this category real;
  until then vision models are scored on interpretation.

Both are listed in the report as explicitly not benchmarked, rather than silently
omitted.

## The conductor benchmark

`scripts/benchmark.py` measures models. `scripts/conductor_bench.py` measures the
*harness*: it runs the same ten coding tasks three times each through three arms —
plain opencode, opencode carrying the doctrine packs, and opencode carrying the
conductor plugin — against the same model through the same router. Ninety headless
runs.

Scoring is the hidden test command's exit status, passed straight through. There is no
partial credit and nothing model-graded anywhere in it.

```bash
# every hidden test must FAIL on its seed - name the set being checked
scripts/conductor_bench.py --verify-tasks --manifest bench/corpus-systems.json
scripts/conductor_bench.py                  # the full ninety-cell run
scripts/conductor_bench.py --report-only    # rebuild the report from existing cells
```

`--verify-tasks` is the honesty check: a task whose hidden test passes on the
unmodified seed measures nothing, so it exits nonzero and names the offenders. It
checks the manifest it is given and no other, so a floor run without `--manifest`
checks the POC set whichever set is about to run. A gate the clock killed answered
nothing and is reported as its own outcome rather than as a failure; raise
`--verify-timeout` and run it again.

| flag                   | default                                        |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `--manifest PATH`      | `bench/conductor-tasks.json`                   |
| `--task ID`            | repeatable; every task in the set              |
| `--tier T0..T4`        | repeatable; every tier                         |
| `--model ID`           | the manifest's `defaults.model`                |
| `--reps N`             | `3`                                            |
| `--verify-timeout SEC` | `600`; the clock one hidden test or suite gets |
| `--results-dir PATH`   | `.data/benchmark/conductor/runs`               |
| `--work-root PATH`     | `<tmp>/llama-leash-conductor-work`           |
| `--report PATH`        | `.data/benchmark/conductor-report.md`          |
| `--router-config PATH` | `.data/configs/conductor-router.json`          |

The work root sits outside this repository and a work root inside it is refused. A
cell's cwd is `<work_root>/<model>/<capability>/<arm>/<task>/rN/repo`, so under the
repository every graded gauge under `bench/corpus/**/hidden/**` is a constant number of
`..` segments away from every cell - and the driver's rule that the hidden files enter
the tree only after opencode exits is a rule a relative path walks around. What this
closes is the walk itself: an arm that greps its way up out of its own tree, which is
what a model debugging a failing run does, lands among other cells' work trees. It is
not a sandbox. The cell's bash tool runs as the user, and the conductor arm's own
opencode config names this repository by absolute path because that is where the plugin
is loaded from, so an arm that goes looking for the corpus on purpose can still find it.
Read a corpus lane's pass rate with that in mind.

`--task` and `--tier` narrow what runs. Values union inside a dimension and the two
dimensions intersect, so `--tier T0 --tier T1` is both tiers and `--tier T1 --task
euler-cli-py` is that one task if it sits in T1. The narrowing happens after the whole
manifest is validated, so the set keeps its guards either way; an unknown id and a
selection matching nothing are both refusals rather than a zero-cell run. A narrowed run
records the selection in the run manifest and prints it at the top of the report, so it
cannot be read as the campaign. A `--report-only` rebuild covers the same selection: a
cell belonging to a task outside it is not that report's to describe.

`--sweep` runs the shape the manifest declares, and is refused alongside every flag it
would otherwise overwrite - `--task`, `--tier`, `--model`, `--capability` and `--reps`.
The sweep block states the models, the capabilities and the repetition count, so a
composed plan would be neither what the manifest declares nor what the operator asked
for, and the report's sweep section would describe a campaign that did not happen.

A task set is a manifest, and there are six. `--manifest` takes one path, has no glob
and discovers nothing, so each set is a separate invocation and a campaign that means to
cover the corpus runs all six:

| Manifest | Tasks | What it holds |
|----------|-------|---------------|
| `bench/conductor-tasks.json` | 23 | the POC set, and the default when `--manifest` is unset |
| `bench/corpus-euler.json` | 20 | Project Euler solvers, generated rather than hand-written |
| `bench/corpus-repair.json` | 5 | debugging and migration repairs drawn from the task corpus |
| `bench/corpus-systems.json` | 4 | systems-implementation tasks with conformance suites for gauges |
| `bench/corpus-perf.json` | 3 | speed gates, where the hidden test is a wall clock |
| `bench/corpus-games.json` | 3 | TUI games: two headless, driven through a scripted input tape, and one built from scratch in C++ and driven through a pseudo-terminal |
| `bench/corpus-snake-ladder.json` | 6 | one C++ Snake in six rungs, each sized under the measured one-response delivery window |

A report describes the manifest it was given and says so at the top, which is a claim
about that set and not about the other six. Sixty-three tasks is the whole corpus and
twenty-three of them are the POC set, so a campaign that runs the default alone has run
under half of it with nothing in its own report to say so.

`bench/corpus-euler.json` is the one manifest a hand edit does not own:
`scripts/generate_euler_tasks.py` writes it from the material under
`bench/corpus/project-euler/`, and `--check` re-derives the file and refuses a drift.
Edit that material and regenerate.

```bash
/usr/bin/python3 scripts/generate_euler_tasks.py           # rewrite the set
/usr/bin/python3 scripts/generate_euler_tasks.py --check   # refuse a hand edit
```

Each entry in a set carries its prompt, the seed the model starts from, and the hidden
files and test command it never sees. A task's seed and hidden file sets are each stated
once, either way round. A small task spells them inline as `seedFiles` and
`hiddenFiles`, path to body. A task whose material is too large for a JSON string names
`seedDir` and `hiddenDir` instead: repo-relative directories, walked in sorted order
and flattened into the identical map, so nothing downstream can tell the two spellings
apart. A directory that is a symlink, holds one, escapes itself, sits inside the other
side's directory, is empty, carries a `.git` tree, holds an entry that is not a regular
file, or holds a file that is not UTF-8 text is a refusal naming the task and the file -
the seeding path writes text and commits it, so a byte-exact binary could not survive
it, and mangling one silently would seed a file that differs from the one the repository
holds. One file may not exceed 1 MiB and one file set may not exceed 8 MiB, so a source
directory that has grown a build tree is a refusal with a size in it.

The optional top-level `expectedTaskCounts` pins the set's per-tier shape, so a lost T3
task cannot hide behind a gained T2 one; a manifest that omits the field states no shape
and is held to none. The per-cell timeout defaults to 1800 seconds. Everything the driver does that is not a process spawn or a file write is a
pure function, which is why `test_conductor_bench.py` can exercise the manifest load,
the arm construction, the run plan, the scoring and the report without starting
opencode or a model.

## Adding a model

Append a `Model` to `CATALOG` in `models_catalog.py`. Quant sizes are only used
for the offline `list` view — the real file list is resolved live at download
time, so you never hard-code filenames. Check your entry with:

```bash
scripts/fetch_models.py info <id> --remote
```

which prints every quant token the repo actually publishes, with real sizes.

// conductor/adapter/config-io.ts — the §2.1 `.conductor/config.json` reader
// (task-let 5.4a). core/types.ts:134's comment was the only mention of that file
// anywhere in the product; this module is its reader, and the ONE place the path
// is spelled, so the plugin and Task 12.2's setup writer cannot disagree about
// where the config lives.
//
// An ADAPTER (G14): it reads the filesystem, so it lives outside the pure core.
// It uses only cross-runtime built-ins (node:fs, node:path) plus the core schema
// validator, so it runs under both the opencode runtime and Node type-stripping.
//
// Two rules shape every branch below:
//
//   1. AN ABSENT CONFIG IS NOT AN ERROR. A repo conductor has never been set up
//      in is the ordinary first-run case (§3.2): the loader reports
//      repoConfigured:false, which is the flag core/gates-phase.ts legalTools
//      already takes, and under which only conductor_setup and conductor_status
//      are legal in every state.
//
//   2. A MALFORMED CONFIG IS ALWAYS LOUD. The loader never falls back to the
//      default on a file it could not read: a repo whose config pins
//      git.mode "read-only" silently becoming the default's mode — or, worse, a
//      permissive one — is a security downgrade the human never asked for. Both
//      failure arms throw, naming the file and (for a schema failure) carrying
//      the validator's own error text, so the human can fix the file rather than
//      discover the downgrade later.

//   verify.requiredScopes []      an entry naming a scope absent from the (empty)
//                                 scope map is an incoherent default.
//   verify.behavioralPaths ["**"] a wrong value here is the difference between an
//                                 enforced TDD law and an optional one. [] would

//                                 narrows it, which is the safe direction.

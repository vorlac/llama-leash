// conductor/adapter/inject.ts — Task 8.2: the §6.4 system-prompt injection layer
// (plan lines 1892-1903, §4.1 roles table 1512-1543, §4.4 router headers 1636-1698,
// §3.8 liveness beacon 1478-1495). Four concerns, one seam:
//   - buildSystemAppend: the `experimental.chat.system.transform` body — the role's
//     doctrine pack(s) verbatim, then a live state block RE-STATED every request and
//     never remembered (G9). A pure function of its inputs.
//   - paramsForRole:     the `chat.params` sampling table (§4.1).
//   - headersFor:        the `chat.headers` §4.4 router tags.
//   - composeDelivery:   the ONE call the composition root makes per request — the
//     three above answered together, plus the receipt fields (which packs, their
//     digest) the §7.4 journal record carries. It exists so the plugin's three
//     hooks cannot each compose a DIFFERENT delivery for the same session: the
//     headers a request is tagged with and the doctrine it carries are two halves
//     of one decision, and the router's affinity is a lie the moment they diverge.
//   - loadPacks/initPlugin: the §6.4 fail-closed init — a missing pack is a startup
//     error surfaced BEFORE the §3.8 beacon is written, so the beacon's ABSENCE
//     proves init failed. loadPacks/initPlugin are the ONLY filesystem-touching
//     functions here; the transform helpers are pure (no I/O, no clock, no
//     randomness), so identical inputs yield byte-identical output (G9).
//
// ADAPTER (G14): the pure helpers borrow only the core `legalTools` derivation
// (§3.1: one legality verdict, three consumers, they can never disagree). The two
// init functions use only node:fs / node:path — no single-runtime global, no shell
// tag, no top-level await — so this runs under BOTH Node type-stripping and the
// alternate opencode plugin runtime.

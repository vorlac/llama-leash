// conductor/adapter/tools.ts — Task 5.3 (gate-hookup half; plan lines 2375-2391,
// §3.5 lines 1334-1427). The ONE function the plugin's tool.execute.before body
// calls, plus the §3.4 tool-name inventory and the tool-class derivation the
// session-registry gate dispatches on.
//
// Adapter module (G14): runs under BOTH the opencode plugin runtime and Node
// type-stripping, so it uses ONLY runtime-agnostic code — no single-runtime
// globals, no shell tag; the only subprocesses are the §3.3 review probe's git
// invocations, through node:child_process with argv arrays (the gitio.ts
// discipline — every test and verify child process goes through
// adapter/evidence.ts instead). All decision logic lives in the PURE core
// gates (core/gates-git.ts, core/gates-edit.ts) and the core shell parser
// (core/shell-parse.ts); this file only SEQUENCES them in the §3.5 order, gathers
// the §7.4 input snapshot, and turns a `deny` decision into the thrown Error that
// opencode reads back to the model as the refusal reason (Task 0.2 wire-notes).
//
// Order (§3.5): the session-registry gate FIRST (spawn denied in every session;
// an unregistered write/conductor denied by the REGISTRY rule), then — for bash —
// the git gate over the WHOLE command and the edit-scope gate over each
// write-shaped target, and — for an edit/write tool — the edit-scope gate over the
// edited path. FAIL-CLOSED (G5): if a pure core decision crashes, the anomaly is
// journaled (gates/gate-crash) and the disposition is decided by a `guarded` flag
// computed from the REAL parse (a git segment or a write shape present, or the
// tool itself writes/advances-state/spawns) — guarded ⇒ deny, harmless read ⇒
// allow. Every deny journals its snapshot under gates/deny (§7.4).

// (7) The §3.3 RED-stage item handlers (Task 9.4a, plan lines 2612-2623): the
// two tools that carry a BEHAVIORAL item from PENDING to TEST_VETTED —
// conductor_submit_test (PENDING->RED) and conductor_vet_test (RED->TEST_VETTED).
// Same §3.4 invariant loop as sections (4)-(6): legality -> derive -> persist ->
// journal -> compact return.
//
// Two rules shape everything here:
//
//   THE HANDLER RUNS THE TEST, NOT THE MODEL (§3.3). Every run and re-run goes
//   through adapter/evidence.ts runTest — the only writer of evidence.jsonl —
//   which substitutes the §2.1 itemTest template, applies the zero-test policy,
//   classifies the failure through core classifyFailure (§2.6.1) and appends +
//   journals the §2.6 record. This file therefore spawns nothing itself, never
//   re-classifies a failure, and never re-implements an FSM edge: the red is
//   admitted by core legalItemTransition's redEvidenceGate (exit != 0 AND class
//   in {assertion, missing-subject}) and by nothing else.
//
//   LEGALITY IS THE GATE'S DERIVATION (§3.2). The legality step asks
//   core/gates-phase.ts legalTools whether THIS tool is offered for THIS item,
//   over the same run/queue/item facts the injection renders — so the handler and
//   the gate cannot disagree (the 9.4a/5.3 deferred binding, ENFORCE: a
//   dependency-unready item is offered no stage tool AND refused by the handler,
//   with no recovery bypass). A denial THROWS before any dispatch or persist, the
//   handleDecide/handleDefer convention, so "nothing was written" is checkable.
//
// Every §2.11 question minted here reuses an EXISTING origin — the origin
// vocabulary is CLOSED (core/types.ts QUESTION_ORIGINS) and this task widens
// nothing: "implementer-blocked" wherever the write-capable test-writer is the
// party that got stuck (submit_test's spent repair budget; a writer that replied
// BLOCKED; a mustFix repair that stopped being a legal red) and
// "review-round-cap" at the vet round cap (the vet loop is a review-round cap
// over the test). Likewise every journal name below is already in the closed
// §7.4 vocabulary (core/journal-events.ts EVENTS).

 *
 * Registers the testScope files of every item BELOW GREEN — those are the tests
 * that may still be red — but only those that EXIST on disk. A declared-but-never-
 * written test poisons nothing and would make the registry name a file no reader
 * can open. Paths already in the workspace registry are not re-added and not

// (9) conductor_dispatch_wave — the §4.2 wave DRIVER (Task 9.4c, plan lines
// 2640-2651, §4.2 lines 1544-1618). The run's work engine: it computes the wave
// through core/schedule nextWave, runs ONE async pipeline per wave member
// through the SHARED fan-out engine (so the orchestrator model never interleaves
// items by hand), and performs PLAN_REVIEWED->EXECUTING on its first call.
//
// The driver REACHES the committed per-item stage handlers rather than
// reimplementing them (§4.2: one implementation, one set of gates, whether the
// model or the driver is calling). It therefore owns exactly the three ordering
// guarantees a per-item tool cannot see from inside its own item:
//
//   BATCHING. The wave advances stage by stage: every active member owing the
//   same stage enters it together as one group, and a stage is entered ONCE per
//   call. A member that drops out (blocked, deferred, env-failed, or stopped by
//   a stage that ran without advancing it) leaves every later group and delays
//   nobody; a member that arrives at a stage the wave has already passed stops
//   there for the next call rather than opening a second group behind it.
//
//   WRITES SERIALIZE PER TREE (§4.3). Read stages overlap freely; the stages
//   whose dispatch is write-capable — plus conductor_publish, whose git index is
//   a singleton — run strictly one at a time, in §4.2 wave order.
//
//   FREEZE (§3.5's freeze-as-scheduling rule). The hold itself is the fan-out
//   engine's and is not re-implemented here: a write-capable job for a frozen
//   tree is HELD and released through TreeState.onClear. The driver owns the two
//   halves the engine cannot own — the NOTIFICATION (it calls notifyClear after
//   every stage execution, so a tree a stage released, or a stale marker the
//   evidence layer broke, deterministically releases the held jobs with no timer
//   and no polling) and the BOUND (a held job nothing will ever release is
//   env-failed rather than awaited forever).
//
// Stages this build does not carry yet — conductor_item_review lands at 9.5a and
// conductor_publish at 9.5b — are reached through an INJECTABLE executor table,
// the same dependency injection as the Fanout, the clock and VerifyOptions. The
// DEFAULT table wires ONLY handlers committed here, and a member that reaches a
// stage no executor serves STOPS there with an envError naming that stage: at
// 9.4c a wave genuinely cannot publish, and the driver says so rather than
// throwing "not implemented", skipping the stage, or advancing an item past work
// that never happened.

// handler: legality -> derive -> persist -> journal -> compact return. Each
// round, in order:
//
//   LENSES. sessions = clamp(readFanout("itemReview"), 3, 6) fresh reviewer
//   sub-sessions (a trivial-classified run always uses the three-session
//   composition), each holding one merged lens group over the item's diff +
//   spec + test. The FIVE mandatory lenses are never truncated by
//   configuration: below six sessions they MERGE pairwise from the tail of the
//   priority list, so even three sessions cover all five. The rosterSizingRule
//   (the E14 resolution): floor at a coverage SET the spec names, clamp where
//   the spec names only a COUNT — parallel.maxReaders is a wall-clock ceiling
//   the fan-out engine enforces internally, NEVER a coverage truncation. A
//   pre-clamp fan-out below three journals a warn-level record on the existing
//   fanout/subsession.dispatched event naming the configured and clamped
//   values (no §7.4 vocabulary widening).
//
//   SKEPTICS. EVERY finding — regardless of severity, deliberately unlike
//   handlePlanReview's majors-only rule: plan review answers one binary
//   question, while item review's output is ROUTED FIXES, and a fix demand
//   nobody adjudicated is not dispatchable — gets readFanout("skeptics")
//   refuters, and survival is decided by core findingSurvives (⌈k/2⌉,
//   TIE-UPHOLDS), never re-derived. An under-delivered panel is re-dispatched
//   ONCE for its missing seats; a verdict still missing after that counts as
//   an UPHOLD — conservative, so a real finding is never dropped because a
//   skeptic session crashed (the Phase 1 deferred binding).
//
//   ADJUDICATION ORDERING. A surviving spec/contract finding discards the
//   round's QUALITY-lens findings (test-adequacy, minimality, perf — doctrine
//   review.md's tiering): judging not-yet-spec-compliant code is wasted
//   judgment, so they are re-derived by the next round's fresh fan-out.
//   Correctness and guardrail are tier-1 — retained and fixed alongside the
//   spec findings.
//
//   ROUTING BY PATH (§3.3 table). A fix touching only fileScope dispatches an
//   implementer; a test-adequacy finding — and any finding whose suggestedFix
//   names a testScope path — dispatches a TEST-WRITER and never the
//   implementer (who is gated to fileScope: routing it there is a guaranteed
//   edit-gate denial); a fix touching both runs the testWriter FIRST, then the
//   implementer, sequentially. A changed test RE-ENTERS the test discipline:
//   re-run through evidence.runTest, the reverted-behavior probe where cheap,
//   then a re-vet with readFanout("vet") fresh critics — all BEFORE
//   re-validate. Every fix dispatch carries the receivingReview registry
//   signal, so buildSystemAppend delivers doctrine receive-review.md to it
//   (the Phase 8 / C-028 deferred binding: loaded is not delivered).
//
//   PUSHBACK. A fix receipt of DONE_WITH_CONCERNS whose concerns name a routed
//   finding id is adjudicated by exactly ONE extra skeptic round carrying the
//   fixer's reasoning verbatim: refuted, the finding dies with no further
//   demand; upheld, the fix is re-demanded once and the loop stops there —
//   pushback is never accepted silently and never loops.
//
//   BOUND. fix => re-validate (evidence.runVerify over the §4.2 foreign-red
//   set) => re-review, bounded by workflow.reviewMaxRounds. At the cap ONE
//   §2.11 question (existing origin "review-round-cap") carries the surviving
//   finding list, the item is blocked via store.setBlocked and STAYS at
//   VALIDATED. A round with zero survivors advances through core
//   legalItemTransition — never a direct state write.

 * (ISSUE-061's throwing writer), or if the conductor that held the workspace
 * before this session is DEAD, report.md is written naming the run's disposition.
 *
 * It is deliberately NOT a stop recorder. Writing run.json here would make the
 * crashed run terminal on this sweep's authority, which would take ISSUE-066's
 * resume path away from a run a human may still answer; the artifact states what

  // config was rewritten and nothing moved" is itself a fact replay needs.
  //
  // The ANSWERED VALUES ride along on every write, first setup included (GAP-015).
  // The written config records what the answers produced; only the record says what
  // was answered — and `acknowledgeNoTdd` in particular has no config field to land
  // in, so without this the one call that turns the TDD law off would leave no trace
  // anywhere. A first setup has no diff to state, hence `changes: []`.

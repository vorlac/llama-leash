// conductor/adapter/continuation.ts — Task 10.1: the §3.7 continuation engine and
// the §3.5(b)/§3.6 ask-gate (plan lines 2731-2745).
//
// An ADAPTER (G14): node:fs / node:path only, plus an INJECTED clock, an INJECTED
// state store and an INJECTED journal. It dispatches ZERO model sub-sessions — the
// idle engine sends ONE message to the orchestrator's own session, and the ask-gate
// answers a permission request. Every durable read and write goes through the
// injected store (G6); every rule it applies is READ from core or from the
// committed handlers in tools.ts, never restated here:
//
//   core/stops.ts isTerminal        — §2.3's ONE terminality test.
//   core/stops.ts shouldTerminate   — the §3.7 wedge rule. FUTILE_RE_PROMPT_LIMIT
//                                     is module-private there and is never
//                                     restated, imported or read from an env var.
//   core/gates-phase.ts legalTools  — the named next action, reached through
//     (via tools.ts waveVerdict)      the ONE committed assembly of its inputs.
//                                     Called DIRECTLY in exactly one other place:
//                                     UNIVERSAL_META_TOOLS probes it over a
//                                     synthetic empty position to derive the meta
//                                     tools that are legal everywhere. That is a
//                                     question about the GATE, not about this run,
//                                     so it assembles no run inputs of its own.
//   core/gates-edit.ts decideEdit   — the inline-claim coverage adjudicator,
//                                     including the `..` and .conductor/** denies.
//   core/decide.ts isHumanTerritory — Task 1.5's §6.2 verdict.
//   tools.ts handleReport           — the §2.9 stop-report, in its stop mode
//                                     (selected from the persisted run.stop). This
//                                     file contains NO report-writing code and no
//                                     stale-red registration of its own.
//   worktrees.ts removeWorktree     — the §4.2 cleanup 9.6 ships with no caller;
//                                     the run-lifecycle owner (this file) calls it.
//
// THE FUTILITY SIGNATURE EXCLUDES run.counters (SG-1). §3.7.2's literal "hash of
// run.json" is self-defeating: run.counters lives INSIDE run.json (core/types.ts),
// so every re-prompt mutates the file and a raw hash would reset futility on every
// pass — the wedge detector could never fire. The signature is a canonical
// projection over run.state, run.classification.kind, run.planReviewRounds, the
// items (id/state/blockedReason/deferredReason) and the questions (id/answered),
// and nothing else: every extra field is another way for a wedged run to look like
// it moved.
//
// THE SIGNATURE IS SAMPLED AT TWO POINTS, NEVER DERIVED TWICE. handleSessionIdle
// samples it when the bus reports the orchestrator idle, and handleOrchestratorTurn
// samples it when the orchestrator finishes a message. The second exists because
// the first cannot see the failure that matters most: a session that generates
// continuously never goes idle, so a run that spins while making no progress was
// invisible to every guard — it ran to the tier ceiling with futileRePrompts 0,
// no stop record and no artifact. Both call the SAME signatureOf and both stop
// through core/stops.ts, which owns both thresholds; this file owns neither.
//
// THE DEBOUNCE, THE ONE-IN-FLIGHT LATCH, THE LAST OBSERVED SIGNATURE AND THE
// CONSECUTIVE-SEND-FAILURE COUNT ARE IN-MEMORY (SG-3), held in a caller-owned
// ContinuationState — the same shape the
// §3.5 registry and the §3.6 override-grant map already use. §2.3's schema has no
// field for any of them and adding one would be a schema change. Only the counters
// are durable, and the signature as of the PREVIOUS re-prompt is not recoverable
// from them: a restarted process can compute today's signature but has nothing to
// compare it against. So a pass with no prior observation on a run that has already
// been re-prompted leaves counters.futileRePrompts exactly as it found it. A
// restart may therefore cost one extra prompt (as it may on the debounce clock);
// it may never cost a live run, because §3.7's wedge detector must fire only on a
// run that is not moving.

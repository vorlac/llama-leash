// check the journal adapter runs on every write — an unlisted event is caught at
// its source rather than leaking into the journal under a name no test can grep.

  //                       record the ONLY trace of it; data.hook names the hook.
  //                       No gate/fsm/state name states that fact — the call was
  //                       not adjudicated, no transition was attempted, and
  //                       nothing was persisted.

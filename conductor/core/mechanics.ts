// conductor/core/mechanics.ts — GAP-005: ONE source for what the doctrine packs
// say about the machine, and the reader the dispatch prompts compose their
// doctrine slice with.
//
// Two jobs, both single-source:
//
//   (1) renderMechanics(pack) DERIVES a short mechanics section for a doctrine
//       pack out of the machine itself — the closed tool vocabulary
//       (./tool-bindings.ts) and the legality machine (./gates-phase.ts). The
//       packs carry the rendered text between the two markers below, and
//       conductor/tests/doctrine-mechanics.test.ts fails the moment a pack's
//       embedded block differs from a fresh derivation. A tool renamed, a stage
//       inserted, an FSM edge moved: the guard goes red and the packs are
//       regenerated. Hand-written pack mechanics drift silently; derived ones
//       cannot, which is the whole point.
//
//   (2) packSection(text, heading) reads ONE named section out of a pack, so a
//       dispatch prompt can carry that section VERBATIM instead of re-spelling
//       its rules in a prompt literal (ISSUE-003: doctrine lived in two unguarded
//       spellings and the unguarded one was the one the model weighted).
//
// The stage sequences are derived by ASKING legalTools what it recommends at each
// FSM position rather than by listing the tools here. A second hand-written list
// is exactly the defect this module exists to remove, and the walk is cheap: it
// is pure computation over ~14 synthetic positions.
//
// Core module (G3): pure — no I/O, no clock, no runtime globals.

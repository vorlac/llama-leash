// one of these forms yields NO subject rather than a fabricated one — the count
// only ever falls, so a criterion the scan cannot read can never be a reason to
// refuse an item.
//

// when the connection is dropped" has the active head "router", and suppressing
// it for a passive five words downstream hid a whole second component behind a

 * is the "this item covers two things" smell that row is aimed at. Criteria that
 * share a subject stay ONE cluster however many they are, so an item may pin
 * several observable checks on the same behaviour.
 *
 * The plan (line 1109) fixes the THRESHOLD and leaves the UNIT undefined, and
 * this is the unit: the SUBJECT a criterion asserts about, resolved against the
 * files the item declares wherever the criterion names one. Four properties
 * carry it, and each answers a measured refusal of an item that covers one thing:
 *
 *   - a criterion that PRESERVES rather than delivers contributes nothing,
 *     because splitting an item never divides such a criterion;
 *   - a criterion whose grammar puts no subject at its front contributes
 *     nothing, rather than contributing the word that happens to be there;
 *   - a file the item declares is ONE cluster however a criterion spells it,
 *     and a symbol a criterion introduces beside its file belongs to that file;
 *   - the count never RISES for anything a planner adds out of discipline: a
 *     guard costs nothing wherever it appears, including in the floor.
 *
 * Against each of those sits the property that keeps the row's teeth, because
 * every one of them is also a shape a planner under re-prompt pressure can
 * reach for: a guard is dropped at its own CLAUSE and only over an artifact it
 * names, a symbol is homed only where it sits beside its file, a passive
 * suppresses only the clause it is in, a directory glob folds nothing, and two
 * declared files fold only where a criterion RELATES them rather than listing
 * them.
 *
 * `context` is the item. Without it the reading is prose-only, which is what
 * makes the function answerable on an acceptance list alone.
 *
 * The return is the cluster NAMES and nothing else, deliberately: a richer
 * partition (deliverables, guards, unresolved) would read better in a violation,
 * and it would also move every assertion that pins this scan's answers — the
 * assertions that certify the row is neither loosened into uselessness nor
 * re-broken in the ways it has been broken already. The legibility that
 * partition buys is bought instead by the violation text, which names the three
 * legal moves rather than the one illegal one.
 *
 * Two token reductions are load-bearing and their ORDER is the rule. Punctuation
 * is stripped off both ends FIRST, because the determiner test is a lookup on a
 * whole word and "the," is not "the" — scanning for the identifier before that
 * step lets a comma smuggle an article back in as a subject and revives "spans 2
 * clusters (parser, the)". Only then is the leading identifier taken, stopping at
 * the first character that cannot appear inside one; stripping the ENDS alone
 * left the call syntax §3.2's observable-check row actively asks for embedded in
 * the middle, so `pad("a") === "[a]"` and `pad("") === ""` — two checks on ONE
 * function — yielded the subjects `pad("a` and `pad` and counted as two clusters,
 * with the name `pad("a` quoted back at the planner.

// PLAN GAP, resolved here once: a §2.10 FINDING carries id/severity/lens/claim/
// evidence/suggestedFix and NO item reference, yet §3.2 requires "every item its
// blocksItems names" to be blocked when the plan-review round cap is reached. The
// PINNED resolution (no schema widening): the finding's own prose IS the
// reference, so a finding blocks an item when its claim+evidence (a) names that
// item's id, or (b) names a file path that intersects the item's fileScope under
// the same conservative core scopesIntersect the wave scheduler uses. A finding
// that names neither blocks nothing — it still becomes a question, and the run
// proceeds on every item (§3.2 "the run proceeds on the remaining items").
//
// The bias is deliberate and one-directional: an over-match blocks an item that
// a human then unblocks with `conductor_answer`, while an under-match lets the
// run execute an item a surviving major says is wrong. So the id scan is
// boundary-anchored (never a substring of a longer word) and the path scan
// refuses a wildcard-headed token, whose empty literal head would otherwise
// intersect EVERY scope and block the whole queue on one sloppy sentence.

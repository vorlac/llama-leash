// conductor/core/tool-legality.ts — GAP-006: the ONE legality declaration table
// every conductor_* call passes through, plus the closed §3.6 override
// vocabulary.
//
// WHAT THIS REPLACES. core/gates-phase.ts legalTools had exactly two production
// consumers — requireStageTool (the six per-item stage tools) and waveVerdict
// (conductor_dispatch_wave). Every other §3.4 name reached its handler with no
// legality question asked of it at all: two layers each assumed the other owned
// the meta tools, and neither did (ISSUE-005). This table is the answer to "who
// owns 'is this tool legal at this position?'" — one row per tool, no exceptions,
// and a name
// with no row is REFUSED rather than run (the growth property: a tool cannot be
// born guarded by nothing).
//
// A row answers two independent questions:
//
//   phase   — WHERE in the run this tool may be called, drawn from the closed
//             PHASE_RULES vocabulary below. The adapter evaluates the rule
//             against PERSISTED state; the rule itself is declared here.
//   callers — WHO may call it. §3.5's registry says whether a session is the
//             orchestrator or a dispatched sub-session, and a dispatched session
//             answering its own blocking question, deferring its own item or
//             closing its own run is marking its own homework (ISSUE-006).
//
// Core module (G3): pure data and pure predicates — no I/O, no clock, no runtime
// globals. The state reading lives in adapter/tools.ts requireToolLegal, which
// is where every stateful legality question in this codebase already lives.

//
//   always         — legal at every position, including with no live run at all
//                    (conductor_status is read-only; conductor_setup adjudicates
//                    its own preconditions; conductor_forget_stale precedes every
//                    run by design, §2.11).
//   verdict        — legal exactly when core/gates-phase.ts legalTools OFFERS the
//                    tool for the run's current position. This is the rule the
//                    meta tools were missing.
//   non-terminal   — legal while the run is live; refused once the run reaches a
//                    §2.3 terminal position or records a stop. legalTools does not
//                    emit these names (they are hatches, not pipeline steps), so
//                    the terminality question is asked here instead of nowhere
//                    (ISSUE-005 (c): inline_claim reopening G8 edit permission on
//                    a REPORTED run).
//   once-at-intake — legal exactly once, at INTAKE, before a classification has
//                    been recorded. conductor_classify's own rule: re-entry is
//                    classification shopping, and on an advanced run it clobbers
//                    queue.json and walks the FSM along edges §3.1 lacks.
//   stage          — the phase question is DELEGATED to a committed legality path

//                    run-FSM edge check for the run pipeline). Delegation, not
//                    exemption: the row still carries the caller rule, and the

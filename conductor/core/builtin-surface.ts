// conductor/core/builtin-surface.ts — the §2 side-effect class of every tool
// conductor's client offers, and the decision that refuses one it cannot class.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Four layers decline to restrict a read-class call:
// classifyTool ends in a catch-all `read`; decideSession allows a registered
// session's non-spawn call and allows a read-class call even from an unregistered
// one; the gate hook forms no further opinion about a non-bash, non-write tool;
// and the client offers `webfetch` to the model with no permission narrowing of
// any kind (adapter/wire-notes.md, 20.2). The composition is not a decision to
// permit those calls — it is the absence of a decision, which is a different and
// worse thing, because nothing records that it happened and nothing fails closed.
//
// This module supplies the missing decision. A built-in that carries no class is
// REFUSED. That inverts a fail-open path, so the ALLOW rows below are as
// load-bearing as the refusal: `read`, `grep`, `glob`, `todowrite` and `skill`
// must each be explicitly permitted or a conductor session loses the ability to
// read the tree it is working in.
//
// TWO TABLES, TWO QUESTIONS, NO OVERLAP. core/tool-legality.ts TOOL_LEGALITY
// governs `conductor_*` names and answers "legal at this position, for this
// caller". This table governs UPSTREAM names and answers "what can this reach".
// A `conductor_*` name is not adjudicated here at all: two tables answering for
// one name is how they drift apart.
//
// Core module: pure, imports only sibling core types.

import type { Decision } from "./gates-edit.ts";
import type { SideEffectClass } from "./types.ts";

// The class of every tool the pinned client can put in front of the model.
//
// The offered set is MEASURED, not assumed — adapter/wire-notes.md "20.1" carries
// it and conductor/tests/wire-contract.test.ts pins it by deepEqual against the
// running binary, so a tool arriving on an opencode bump turns that test red
// before it can arrive here unclassified.
//
// `bash` is deliberately ABSENT. It has no single class: `ls` is R0, a checker is
// R1, `man` is R2, `curl` is R3 and `sed -i` is W. Naming one class for it is the
// same catch-all this module exists to remove, so a bash call is classified from
// its COMMAND by the caller and passed in.
//
// The registry-only names are classified even though 1.18.15 does not offer them.
// They are one config flip from reachable, and a class declared ahead of that
// flip is what stops it from also silently widening the surface.

  // `opencode run` — every benchmark cell — puts it in front of the model, where
  // it blocks the session on an operator who does not exist. R0 stays because
  // reach is this table's question; the refusal lives in adapter/tools.ts, which
  // denies the tool itself ahead of every other gate. `invalid` is where opencode
  // redirects a call to a tool the agent may not use, so refusing it would
  // replace a clear upstream message with a conductor refusal for a call that

// Task 10.1 RED tests — FINAL LOCATION conductor/tests/continuation.test.ts.
//
// SUBJECT (must NOT exist when this goes red): conductor/adapter/continuation.ts. The
// failure is `Cannot find module '../adapter/continuation.ts'` — the missing-subject
// shape, a legal red per §2.6.1. Three rows go red as ASSERTION failures rather than as
// the unresolved import (they drive ALREADY-EXPORTED bindings and assert NEW behaviour
// from them, exactly as 9.4c's gate row and 9.5c's override rows did):
//   [10.1-binding-decide-human-territory]      — adapter/tools.ts handleDecide
//   [10.1-binding-question-reuse-no-duplicate] — adapter/tools.ts handleSubmitTest/handleVetTest
//   [10.1-plugin-event-hook-routes]            — plugin/index.ts ConductorPlugin
// Those three still fail through this file's top-level import, which is the point: the
// file is one contract and it goes green only when every part of it is built.
//
// Spec read (docs/plans/2026-08-07-conductor-harness-plan.md):
//   Task 10.1 (2731-2745) — the authoritative behaviour of this task.
//   §3.7 (1456-1476)      — the continuation engine: idle detection, the re-prompt, the
//                           2s debounce, the futile-signature wedge detector, halt.
//   §2.3 (705-711)        — isTerminal, ONE definition; "EXECUTING with a stop" included.
//   §2.9 (888-917)        — the stop vocabulary, who records which kind, and the rule
//                           that every stop writes a report through the ONE writer.
//   §2.8 (877-883)        — the AnomalyRecord kind:"disengage" shape.
//   §3.5 (1334-1427)      — the session registry, the ask surface, the edit gate.
//   §3.6 (1428-1455)      — the inline claim that scopes an orchestrator edit.
//   §6.2 (1851-1879)      — human territory; Task 1.5's isHumanTerritory verdict.
//   §2.11 (979-1008)      — questions.jsonl and the stale-red registry.
//   docs/build/specs/task-10.1.assertions.json — the 32 rows mapped 1:1 to the 32 tests
//                           below, its dependsOnUnbuilt / verifiedAgainstHead facts, its
//                           correctionsToDraft rulings and its fourteen resolved specGaps.
//   conductor/adapter/wire-notes.md:32-34,55-59,109-110 — the `permission.asked` BUS event
//                           (the typed `permission.ask` plugin hook is never dispatched at
//                           1.18.15), and the reply route
//                           client.postSessionIdPermissionsPermissionId({path:{id,
//                           permissionID}, body:{response:'once'|'always'|'reject'}}).
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// PINNED SPEC-GAP RESOLUTIONS (from task-10.1.assertions.json; this file is the contract
// that pins them):
//  (G1) THE FUTILITY SIGNATURE EXCLUDES run.counters (SG-1). run.counters lives INSIDE
//       run.json (core/types.ts:205), so §3.7.2's literal "hash of run.json" is
//       self-defeating: every re-prompt mutates run.json, so a raw hash resets futility on
//       every pass and the wedge detector can never fire. The signature is a canonical
//       projection with sorted keys over
//         {run.state, run.classification.kind, run.planReviewRounds,
//          items sorted by id as {id, state, blockedReason, deferredReason},
//          questions sorted by id as {id, answered}}
//       and NOTHING else. Deliberately narrow: every extra field is another way for a
//       wedged run to look like it moved.
//  (G2) THE COUNTER ORDER INSIDE ONE PASS is: consult core/stops.ts shouldTerminate with
//       the PERSISTED counters FIRST, then (on the re-prompt path) update the counters and
//       save, then send the prompt. That is the only order in which both
//       [10.1-noop-after-three-futile] ("exactly three prompts, the fourth idle stops") and
//       [10.1-futile-signature-excludes-counters] ("futileRePrompts reads 1 then 2 then 3
//       across the three re-prompt passes") are simultaneously true. The update rule is:
//       a signature that DIFFERS from the last one this engine observed sets
//       futileRePrompts to 0; anything else (equal, or no observation yet) increments it.
//       idleRePrompts increments on every pass that actually sends a prompt.
//  (G3) NO RECOMMENDATION ⇒ NO PROMPT (SG-2). core/gates-phase.ts:456 shows a reachable
//       NON-terminal EXECUTING verdict with recommended === null. That pass journals
//       continuation/idle carrying legalTools' own `why`, prompts nothing, and leaves BOTH
//       counters untouched — it is not a futile re-prompt, because it is not a re-prompt.
//  (G4) DEBOUNCE AND ONE-IN-FLIGHT LIVE IN A CALLER-OWNED IN-MEMORY OBJECT (SG-3), the
//       same shape the §3.5 `registry` Map and the §3.6 `overrideGrants` Map already use.
//       §2.3's schema has no field for either and adding one would be a schema change.
//       `createContinuationState()` mints it; both handlers take it as `state`.
//  (G5) ARCHIVAL (SG-4, the C-029(a) binding): the engine archives ANY terminal run it
//       observes at idle, in the SAME pass, AFTER any stop-report it owes and AFTER
//       worktree cleanup. store.archiveRun only clears the pointer (state.ts:563), so it
//       is idempotent. A question run reaches ANSWERED with NO queue.json on disk
//       (conductor_classify's question path never decomposes), so the archival pass must
//       tolerate a missing queue.
//  (G6) THE NEEDS_CONTEXT CONVERSION IS PRODUCED BY THE ASK-GATE AND DELIVERED BY THE
//       ENGINE (SG-5). adapter/fanout.ts has no permission awareness and FanoutResult
//       (:66) has no channel for a mid-session event, so handlePermissionAsked RETURNS and
//       RECORDS {sessionID, itemId, status:"NEEDS_CONTEXT", neededContext} into the shared
//       ContinuationState, and the next orchestrator re-prompt surfaces it EXACTLY ONCE.
//       No new §2.10 status, no schema change.
//  (G7) THE C-029(b) GUARD LIVES INSIDE handleDecide (SG-6), beside the existing
//       requireTwoOptions check at adapter/tools.ts:850 — conductor_decide arrives as a
//       TOOL CALL, never as a permission ask, and continuation.ts imports FROM tools.ts,
//       so a tools.ts -> continuation.ts import would close a cycle.
//  (G8) "ACTIVE CLAIM" (SG-8) means item.inlineClaim !== null AND item.state !== "PUBLISHED".
//       The committed adapter/tools.ts inlineClaimScopeFor (:7674) implements only the
//       first half. ONE exported derivation, `activeInlineClaimScope(store, runId)`, adds
//       the second and returns the flat `string[] | null` BOTH seams take — the
//       tool.execute.before gate's GateHookInput.inlineClaimScope (tools.ts:218) and the
//       permission reply. The mid-FSM half of §3.6's expiry ("leaves its CURRENT state")
//       is NOT computable from committed state and is NOT implemented here.
//  (G9) THE ORCHESTRATOR HAS NO TREE (SG-9). adapter/chat-message.ts:75 registers
//       {role:"orchestrator"} with no `tree`, and both decideEdit consumers read
//       `entry?.tree ?? ""` (tools.ts:338), which mangles an ABSOLUTE ask path:
//       core/gates-edit.ts:128 turns "/repo/src/a.ts" into "repo/src/a.ts", which matches
//       no tree-relative scope. ONE exported helper resolves the session tree as
//       `entry.tree ?? store.root` and BOTH seams use it. chat-message.ts is NOT edited.
//  (G10) THE ASK PAYLOAD'S FILE PATH IS NOT WIRE-PINNED (SG-10; wire-notes.md:110 records
//       patterns/metadata as never asserted). Extraction order is metadata.filePath, then
//       metadata.path, then a single CONCRETE (wildcard-free) entry of `patterns`; when
//       none yields a path the ask FAILS CLOSED (reject), even under an active claim. The
//       question text extraction is the same shape: metadata.question, then metadata.text;
//       when neither yields text the journalled record carries humanTerritory false plus
//       textAvailable false — the verdict is never fabricated — and the reply is allow.
//  (G11) THE STOP-REPORT IS THE COMMITTED handleReport (adapter/tools.ts:7283) IN ITS STOP
//       MODE, which it selects from `run.stop !== null` (:7310). continuation.ts records
//       the stop and then DRIVES that one writer; it contains no report-writing code and
//       no second stale-red registration. `deps.writeStopReport` overrides it for the
//       write-ahead-ordering row only.
//  (G13) ANSWERING RELEASES AN ITEM ONLY WHEN NO OPEN QUESTION STILL NAMES IT (C-056's
//       residual, adjudicated onto this task). handleSurface (adapter/tools.ts:890-956)
//       applies FIRST-BLOCK-WINS: it records which named items are ALREADY blocked (:899-908)
//       and skips them (:938), but it STILL appends its question with the item in its own
//       blocksItems (:914-925). So two open questions can name one item while §2.5's single
//       `blocked` disposition carries only the first — and adapter/questions.ts answerQuestion
//       (:125) keys the release purely on `blocked.questionId === questionId`, so answering the
//       FIRST releases an item the SECOND still gates. RULE: on release, re-block on the OLDEST
//       still-open question that names the item, and release only when none remains. Two
//       consequences this file pins:
//         - the successor search must EXCLUDE the question being answered. answerQuestion marks
//           the question answered LAST (:176-179, the C-018/C-020 clear-first wedge order), so a
//           naive "scan the open questions" during the clear phase finds the very question being
//           answered and re-blocks the item on itself.
//         - a re-blocked item is NOT reported in clearedItemIds. handleAnswer (:986-994) journals
//           state/item.updated with `blocked: null` for every id it returns there, so listing an
//           item that is still blocked would make the journal say the opposite of the disk.
//  (G12) WORKTREE REMOVAL IS 10.1's CALL (C-037 ruling 6). adapter/worktrees.ts
//       removeWorktree ships at 9.6 with no caller by design; its committed signature is
//       FOUR parameters — removeWorktree(workspace, runId, itemId, {stateHome, workspaceKey})
//       — not the three the 10.1 spec's dependsOnUnbuilt section quotes.
//
// PINNED INTERPRETATIONS THIS FILE ADDS (judgement calls the rows leave open; the
// implementer must target these exactly):
//  (P1) handleSessionIdle DOES NOT AWAIT THE PROMPT IT SENDS. It fires the prompt, latches
//       "one in flight" in the ContinuationState, and returns; the latch clears when the
//       prompt settles. Awaiting it would make [10.1-one-reprompt-in-flight] unobservable.
//  (P2) THE PASS ORDER is: (a) orchestrator-only check; (b) currentRun; (c) the C-032 E7
//       orphan-question reconciliation — the row says "BEFORE any re-prompt or stop
//       decision"; (d) halt ⇒ interrupt (halt outranks the debounce, the recommendation
//       and the futility rule alike); (e) isTerminal ⇒ worktree cleanup + archive, never a
//       prompt; (f) the futility signature and the progress reset — a run that MOVED since
//       the last re-prompt is not wedged, so the comparison must precede the verdict that
//       would stop it; (g) shouldTerminate; (h) the verdict; (i) debounce/in-flight;
//       (j) counters + prompt.
//  (P3) THE ENGINE WRITES ONLY TWO STOP KINDS: `noop` (its own futility rule) and
//       `interrupt` (halt). A shouldTerminate verdict of blocked / surfaced / env is NOT
//       recorded here — §2.9:900-905 assigns blocked/surfaced/done to the report tool and
//       env to the fan-out engine and handleOverride (which already records it at
//       tools.ts:7772).
//  (P4) THE PLUGIN'S `event` HOOK IS A THIN BODY delegating to the ONE adapter function
//       `handlePluginEvent`, exactly as `tool.execute.before` delegates to
//       gateBeforeToolCall. The plugin opens its workspace LAZILY (never at construction —
//       tests/gate-wiring.test.ts constructs the factory against a directory that does not
//       exist and must keep passing), reads its §2.1 Config from <root>/.conductor/config.json,
//       and seeds the §3.5 registry entry for the PERSISTED run's own sessionID
//       (core/types.ts Run.sessionID) as role "orchestrator" — the entry
//       adapter/chat-message.ts:75 writes, reconstructed from persisted state rather than
//       invented. How the plugin resolves stateHome/workspaceKey is NOT pinned here.
//  (P5) FAIL-SOFT (G5 of the build guards) means: the event hook catches, journals ONCE at
//       level "error" under a name core/journal-events.ts isKnownEvent accepts, and
//       resolves. This file asserts the level and the vocabulary membership, not the
//       spelling.

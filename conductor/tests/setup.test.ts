// Task 12.2 RED tests — FINAL LOCATION conductor/tests/setup.test.ts.
//
// SUBJECT (must NOT exist when this goes red):
//   adapter/tools.ts  handleSetup            — the conductor_setup handler (§3.4; its NAME and
//                                              its {reconfigure?} arg schema are ALREADY
//                                              registered at tools.ts:112 / plugin/index.ts:224
//                                              and asserted by tests/gate-wiring.test.ts:240 —
//                                              NONE of that registration is new work here)
//   adapter/tools.ts  SETUP_PROBE_SCHEMA_NAME — the SCHEMAS key the §2.1:630 schema probe
//                                              constrains its request with and validates its
//                                              reply against, through core validate()
//   adapter/gitio.ts  initRepo               — the §3.9:1500 "initialize a repo here" branch;
//                                              gitio exports read queries ONLY at HEAD
//   adapter/config-io.ts loadConfig / DEFAULT_CONFIG
//                                            — task-let 5.4a's §2.1 config reader and its
//                                              single-source default Config. 12.2 CONSUMES
//                                              them; it does not author a second reader and it
//                                              does not retype a second default.
// Every other import in this file resolves to a committed export at HEAD, so the red is the
// missing-subject shape (§2.6.1): `Cannot find module '../adapter/config-io.ts'` first, and
// the missing named bindings from tools.ts / gitio.ts behind it.
//
// Spec read:
//   docs/plans/2026-08-07-conductor-harness-plan.md
//     Task 12.2 (2890-2913) — the authoritative behaviour of this task.
//     §2.1 (478-636)        — the config shape, the four itemTest defaults, the detection
//                             list, the two undefaultable questions, and the SETUP PROOF
//                             TABLE (628-632) with its law at :634 — "A failed check is a
//                             setup failure with a named remedy, not a warning."
//     §3.4 (1327)           — conductor_setup's row: legal while config is absent, or with
//                             reconfigure:true (no live run + a journaled config diff).
//     §3.9 (1498-1508)      — isRepo false ⇒ the one interactive choice; what no-git sets.
//     §6.2 (1874-1875)      — mid-run interactive interruption is sanctioned for exactly two
//                             things, one of which is `git.mode` first-run setup.
//   docs/build/specs/task-12.2.assertions.json — the 28 rows below, its verifiedAgainstHead
//     facts, its correctionsToDraft rulings, its reusesExisting list, its 19 specGaps, and
//     its orchestratorAmendment_2026_08_14 (the 5.4a collision).
//   docs/build/specs/task-5.4a.assertions.json — row 5.4a-default-config-is-safe-not-permissive,
//     which pins DEFAULT_CONFIG as the single source this task builds its candidate from.
//   router/UPSTREAM_CONTRACT.md + CORRECTIONS.md C-058 — the live measurements this file's
//     slot-count and schema-probe rows are built on (see M1/M2/M3 below).
//   CORRECTIONS.md C-003 — bare `pytest` is not on PATH on this machine.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// MEASURED FACTS this file is built on (never assumed; re-measured in-file where a test
// depends on them, so a machine change turns into a loud failure and not a silent pass).
//
//  (M1) llama-server reports its slot count at GET /props -> total_slots. Measured on
//       qwen3.6-27b / llama-server 10298: 4 with no `--parallel`, 6 with `--parallel 6`
//       (UPSTREAM_CONTRACT.md:21-22,57-80). Those are the two numbers the slot rows use, and
//       §2.1's default parallel.maxReaders is 6 — so "no --parallel" is exactly the failing
//       configuration the proof exists to catch.
//  (M2) `--ctx-size` is the TOTAL context divided among slots: `--parallel 6` beside an
//       unchanged `--ctx-size 8192` cuts every slot's window to 1536 (C-058 F3). A remedy
//       that names `--parallel` alone therefore instructs the user into a 6x context cut, so
//       the remedy string is asserted to name `--ctx-size` too.
//  (M3) A schema-constrained probe can return EMPTY content with a 200 status — the 27B model
//       spent a full 1024-token budget reasoning and returned "" (C-058 F1-CONFIRMED). An
//       empty body is therefore a FAILING probe: a check that accepted "" would pass against a
//       model that can never produce structured output at all.
//  (M4) `pytest` is not on PATH here; `/usr/bin/python3 -m pytest` is pytest 8.4.2 (C-003).
//       Re-measured in [12.2-c003-pytest-measured] before it is relied on.
//  (M5) `go --version` exits 2 on this toolchain (measured) while spawning perfectly well —
//       the case that makes "unspawnable, not unhappy" a real distinction.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// PINNED SPEC-GAP RESOLUTIONS + INTERPRETATIONS (this file is the contract that pins them;
// the implementer must target these exactly).
//
//  (P1) TWO-PHASE, and the ANSWERS TRANSPORT (spec gap "answers transport"). §3.4 pins the
//       tool args as {reconfigure?} only, but the two undefaultable answers must reach the
//       handler. handleSetup takes an optional `answers` object; the tool spec in
//       plugin/index.ts gains the same optional arg (a recorded plan deviation — tool args are
//       not a LAW closed vocabulary; no §2 schema, state field or journal event is touched).
//       A call WITHOUT every required answer runs DETECTION + the SMOKE SPAWN, returns the
//       proposals and the open asks, and WRITES NOTHING. A call carrying every required
//       answer additionally runs the three live proofs and, only if all pass, writes.
//  (P2) ILLEGALITY THROWS; A FAILED PROOF RETURNS. An out-of-contract CALL (already configured
//       without reconfigure:true; reconfigure with a live run) THROWS an Error naming the legal
//       alternative — the committed handleX convention. A failed setup CHECK returns
//       {ok:false, written:false, failures:[…]} so every named remedy is narrated at once;
//       §2.1:634 makes it a failure either way, and it is not an illegal call.
//  (P3) THE SLOT PROOF HAS TWO LEGS, neither of them a stopwatch. Leg 1 is the spec row's own
//       mechanism: parallel.maxReaders concurrent trivial completions on /v1/chat/completions —
//       the ONE path a router proxies (router.hpp:104-108) — every one of which must come back
//       served. Leg 2 is the capacity number, GET {origin}/props -> total_slots (M1). Leg 1
//       alone cannot see a server that ACCEPTS every reader and then queues them (llama-server
//       does exactly that at --parallel 1); leg 2 alone never issues the fan-out the row
//       specifies, and /props is not under /v1, so a healthy router 404s it — which is why leg 2
//       retries the UPSTREAM origin directly rather than treating a routing fact as a proof
//       failure. Wall-clock overlap is what the row forbids and is measured nowhere.
//  (P4) THE SCHEMA PROBE registers its own tiny schema into the (deliberately mutable, see
//       core/types.ts:1238-1242) SCHEMAS record under SETUP_PROBE_SCHEMA_NAME, sends it as the
//       request's response_format.json_schema.schema, and validates the reply through core
//       validate(SETUP_PROBE_SCHEMA_NAME, parsed). One object, both ends — no second schema
//       literal. This registers a PROBE schema; it changes no §2 artifact schema.
//  (P5) THE ORIGIN IS RESOLVED INSIDE THE HANDLER. handleSetup takes {router, upstream,
//       failoverState} and calls router-client resolveBaseUrl itself, because the fail-soft row
//       requires it to RE-resolve after noteRouterFailure latches useUpstream. (The spec's
//       "the origin is an INPUT" phrasing cannot satisfy its own G5 row; the configs are the
//       input instead.) Probes are DIRECT bounded node:http with stream:false — never through
//       opencode's prompt path, which wire-notes.md:41-55 proved emits no response_format.
//  (P6) SMOKE COVERAGE IS OBSERVABLE. proposals.smoked is the list of probes actually spawned:
//       {source, argv0, ok}, one row per command the config would record — every scope
//       `command`, every scope `itemTest` (substituted against a representative testScope
//       file), and every format-rule command. Without it "the check covers every command" is
//       an unverifiable claim, since a scope command and its itemTest almost always share an
//       argv[0]. The probe is [argv0, "--version"], shell:false, under evidence.childEnv, with
//       closed stdin and a bounded kill timeout; ok:false means the process could not be
//       SPAWNED (spawnSync `error` set), never that it exited non-zero (M5).
//  (P7) THE NODE itemTest IS ATTACHED ON RECOGNITION, NOT ON detectRunner. evidence.ts:137
//       falls back to the node profile for EVERY unrecognized command, so detectRunner(["jest"])
//       IS the node profile — keying the attachment on detectRunner would staple
//       `node --test {files}` onto a jest repo, the precise silent-wrong-answer the spec row
//       exists to prevent. The template attaches iff basename(argv[0]) starts with "node" or
//       the argv contains "--test". Asserted as the converse (a node template implies a
//       recognized node command), which is the checkable direction.
//  (P8) SCOPE NAMES ARE THE ECOSYSTEM KEYS — node | python | go | cmake | cargo — so a
//       multi-ecosystem repo cannot silently overwrite one scope with another, and each
//       proposal carries `ecosystem` and `sourceGlob` alongside the §2.1 scope fields.
//       requiredScopes is one entry per scope: pattern "**" when exactly one ecosystem was
//       detected, otherwise that ecosystem's sourceGlob — an EXTENSION glob (**/*.{js,ts,...}),
//       not a directory glob, so two ecosystems in one repo cover the repo's sources between
//       them instead of both claiming src/** and leaving lib/, include/ and test/ to nobody.
//  (P9) THE DIFF JOURNAL EVENT is `state` / `config.updated`, added to core/journal-events.ts
//       EVENTS.state under that file's own sanctioned-widening rule (the `decision.recorded`
//       precedent, C-029 F7). data.changes is [{key, from, to}] over dotted key paths, ONLY
//       the changed keys, and an empty array when nothing changed. Setup journals through a
//       runId-OPTIONAL sink shaped like adapter/state.ts:47 StateJournal, because it has no run.
// (P10) THE §2.11 QUESTION LEDGER IS NOT TOUCHED. The two asks are the handler's RESULT
//       (§6.2:1875's sanctioned interactive ask). No questions.jsonl is written and the
//       QuestionRecord origin vocabulary is not widened.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Assertion id -> test (each test name carries its row id as its FIRST token):
//   12.2-detect-itemtest-templates    -> the five-ecosystem matrix: argv arrays, the §2.1:499
//                                        templates, and every proposal round-tripped through
//                                        the COMMITTED detectRunner + substituteItemTest.
//   12.2-detect-go-dirs               -> {dirs} targets package dirs; no go argv carries -run.
//   12.2-detect-node-scripts-test     -> scripts.test is read and tokenized by shellTokens; the
//                                        node template attaches only to a recognized node cmd.
//   12.2-detect-multi-ecosystem       -> two scopes, one requiredScopes entry each; never empty.
//   12.2-detect-behavioral-paths      -> per-ecosystem proposals, carried on the ask, never
//                                        written unanswered; the go ask names the _test.go caveat.
//   12.2-detect-cargo                 -> cargo proposal, no itemTest, no fifth RUNNER_PROFILE.
//   12.2-no-build-command             -> scope key sets exactly; setup writes no buildCommand,
//                                        and a hand-written one VALIDATES.
//   12.2-smoke-spawn-unspawnable-fails-> an unspawnable argv[0] fails setup, names argv+remedy,
//                                        writes nothing; coverage over commands/itemTests/rules.
//   12.2-smoke-spawn-semantics        -> non-zero exit passes; shell metacharacters are one
//                                        executable name; childEnv hygiene; bounded timeout.
//   12.2-proof-models-default         -> the §2.1:629 proof, against a recorded GET /v1/models.
//   12.2-models-default-derived       -> derived from the list or the caller, never guessed.
//   12.2-proof-schema-probe           -> the §2.1:630 proof; request shape asserted; an EMPTY
//                                        reply FAILS (M3).
//   12.2-proof-slot-count             -> the §2.1:631 proof at the measured 4-vs-6 (M1); the
//                                        remedy names --parallel and --ctx-size (M2).
//   12.2-zero-model-dispatch          -> three direct requests, no model sub-session at all.
//   12.2-proofs-origin-fail-soft      -> a dead router is not a setup failure (G5).
//   12.2-proof-before-write           -> every failure leg leaves the repo unconfigured.
//   12.2-two-asks-no-default          -> both undefaultable asks; zero question records.
//   12.2-partial-answers-write-nothing-> one answer is not enough; no §2.1 example is defaulted.
//   12.2-nogit-offer                  -> the §3.9 single choice; `git init` from the HANDLER.
//   12.2-nogit-config                 -> read-only + writes off, and NO invented field.
//   12.2-exclude-registration         -> the committed registerConductorExclude, once, and not
//                                        at all when a proof failed.
//   12.2-config-written-atomic-valid  -> the written file, field by field, against DEFAULT_CONFIG
//                                        and the §2.1 numbers.
//   12.2-repo-configured-one-derivation-> gate and handler never disagree; corrupt reopens setup.
//   12.2-setup-legality               -> legal while absent, refuses when configured.
//   12.2-reconfigure-live-run-denies  -> isTerminal is the predicate; the config is untouched.
//   12.2-reconfigure-diff-journaled   -> the diff, through the REAL throwing journal.
//   12.2-c003-pytest-measured         -> the pytest fallback, measured on this machine.
//   12.2-no-new-runtime-dependency    -> G1/G14 source scan of the touched adapter modules.

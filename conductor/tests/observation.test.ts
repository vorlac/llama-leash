// conductor/tests/observation.test.ts — Task 22B RED tests for the run-state
// snapshot, the strain signals and the breakdown thresholds
// (tools/observation.ts) and the reader over them (tools/observe.ts).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The stated purpose of the campaign is that a stronger model
// watches this harness work at increasing scope and identifies where it breaks.
// The data mostly exists already — the orchestrator's stream is captured per
// cell, every sub-session is journaled with its own id, and the gate, FSM and
// evidence layers are journaled in full. What is missing is assembly.
//
// READ-ONLY BY CONSTRUCTION. The observer must not be able to perturb the run it
// is watching, and the strongest form of that is structural rather than
// disciplinary: this derivation is a PURE function of records that already
// exist, driven from a separate process that only reads the run directory. There
// is no conductor code path an observer can enter, so there is nothing to be
// careful about.
//
// THRESHOLDS ARE DECLARED HERE, BEFORE THE CAMPAIGN. That is the whole point of
// 22B.3: a threshold chosen after seeing the data is a description of the data,
// not a hypothesis about the system.

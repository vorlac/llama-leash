// The §3.2 item-size row's acceptance-CLUSTER count (core/planning.ts).
//
// SUBJECT: `acceptanceClusters`, and the size row in `validateQueue` that reads
// it. The row asks "does this item cover more than one thing?" and answered it
// by taking each criterion's first non-determiner WORD as that criterion's
// subject. A word's position in an English sentence is not its subject, so the
// count was an artifact of prose style: two live runs were refused for items
// that cover exactly one thing.
//
// The two refusals are pinned verbatim below as regression fixtures:
//   (A) run r-20260821-47df, journal seq 32 — three checks on one function
//       counted as the clusters (slugify, leading, export).
//   (B) the corpus campaign's euler-001-py conductor arm — seven criteria about
//       one solver counted as seven clusters. The arm spent 43.9 minutes and
//       337,052 tokens without leaving INTAKE.
//
// The rows are grouped by the three causes the reproductions established:
//   1. one file spelled two ways counted twice;
//   2. sentence-leading words that are not subjects leaking in as subjects;
//   3. regression GUARDS ("src/registry.py is not modified") counted as
//      subjects, so the row charged an item for promising not to break things.
//
// Every loosening row is paired with a TEETH row. A guard that over-fires is
// visible in the journal; one that never fires is invisible, so the two-things
// corpus at the bottom is asserted as a RATE against the same corpus the old
// scan is measured on, and may not fall below it.

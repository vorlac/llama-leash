// conductor/tests/live-console.test.ts — the live run console: the derivations a
// watcher reads a run through while it is still running, and the renderer that
// puts them on a terminal.
//
// WHY THESE ROWS AND NOT OTHERS. Every assertion here is anchored to one
// preserved 45-minute run (.data/analysis/evidence, run r-20260821-0a31) that
// timed out. In that run the FSM made exactly ONE transition and then sat at the
// same position for 36 minutes while the model generated continuously; the state
// block recommended one tool on all 16 orchestrator requests of the EXECUTING
// phase and the model called something else every time; two auto-compactions ate
// 472.9 seconds; and two of three tool failures were refusals that wrote no
// journal record at all. A console that renders a timeline and nothing else
// would have shown that run as healthy. So the derivations under test are the
// four signals that would have named the deadlock: the stall clock, the
// recommendation against the tool actually called, refusals, and the compaction
// shape — plus the sub-session exchanges (what a sub-agent was asked and what it
// answered) and the per-turn cost joined from the router ledger.
//
// The subject splits the way the two tools already split: PURE derivations in
// conductor/tools/observation.ts, which imports nothing and reads no clock, and
// the I/O plus formatting in conductor/tools/observe.ts. Every derivation test
// below therefore runs on synthetic records with no filesystem at all.

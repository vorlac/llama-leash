// conductor/tests/builtin-surface.test.ts — Task 21.3 RED tests for the built-in
// classification table and its deny point (core/builtin-surface.ts).
//
// WHAT THIS INVERTS. At HEAD four layers decline to restrict a read-class call:
// classifyTool ends in a catch-all `return "read"`; decideSession returns ALLOW
// for a registered session's non-spawn call AND for a read-class call from an
// UNREGISTERED one; gateBeforeToolCall makes no further decision for a non-bash,
// non-write tool; and the pinned client offers `webfetch` to the model. So a tool
// nobody classified reaches the model with no gate having formed an opinion.
//
// This table inverts that: a built-in with no class is REFUSED. That is a
// tightening, and the risk it carries is over-denial — `read`, `grep`, `glob`,
// `todowrite` and `skill` must each be explicitly ALLOWED or a conductor session
// loses the ability to read files. The allow rows below are therefore as
// load-bearing as the deny, and the [21.3-still-reads] row is the one that proves
// the tightening did not break the harness.
//
// The class vocabulary is core/types.ts SIDE_EFFECT_CLASSES (§2). The offered
// built-in set is measured, not assumed: conductor/adapter/wire-notes.md "20.1"
// carries it, pinned by wire-contract.test.ts against the running binary.

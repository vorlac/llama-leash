// conductor/tools/observation.ts — the run-state snapshot, the strain signals and
// the breakdown thresholds an observer reads a live or finished run through.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The campaign's purpose is that a stronger model watches this
// harness work at increasing scope and says where it breaks. Most of the data
// already exists: the orchestrator's stream is captured per cell, every
// sub-session is journaled with its own id, and the gate, FSM and evidence layers
// are journaled in full. What was missing is assembly — and, before Task 21.1,
// the sub-sessions where most of the work happens were invisible in the session
// an observer was watching.
//
// READ-ONLY BY CONSTRUCTION. The observer must not be able to perturb the run it
// is watching, and the strongest form of that is structural rather than
// disciplinary. Everything here is a PURE function of records that already exist,
// driven from a separate process that only reads the run directory. There is no
// conductor code path an observer can enter, so there is nothing to be careful
// about — which is the property a rule about being careful cannot deliver.
//
// It lives under tools/ rather than core/ for the same reason conductor/tools/atlas.ts
// does: nothing in the running harness consumes it. It is pure and imports nothing, but
// a pure module in core/ with no core caller is the dead-export shape the reachability
// audit exists to refuse, and an observation derivation is an observation tool.

// held the same position for 36 minutes while the model generated continuously.

//
//   the STALL CLOCK    — seconds since anything actually advanced, which is a
//                        different quantity from seconds since the last record.
//   RECOMMENDED vs ACTUAL — the state block names one next tool per request; the
//                        model called something else sixteen times running.
//   REFUSALS           — a handler-level refusal and a gate deny are the two

 * of a planning-phase mechanical or skeptic session — so the shortfall is not a
 * hypothetical.
 *
 * The rule here is therefore: a role gets its cost column only when the group
 * carries at least one entry per SETTLED turn of that role. A role that does not
 * is named in `partialRoles` and gets nothing, and the caller prints the total as
 * partial. A turn beyond the entries at the tail of a covered role keeps null —
 * that is a live run's newest request, not a gap.

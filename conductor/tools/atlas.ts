// conductor/tools/atlas.ts — the END-TO-END ATLAS: one machine-checkable map of
// what happens to a prompt from the moment opencode receives it to the moment a
// result is published into the workspace.
//
// WHY THIS IS DATA AND NOT A DIAGRAM. A hand-drawn picture of this system is
// wrong the day after it is drawn, and a picture cannot be tested. The node set
// here is instead PINNED against the closed vocabularies the code already owns —
// the §7.4 journal events, the §3.1/§3.3 FSM states, the §2.9 stop kinds, the
// §3.4 tool inventory and the §6.4 hook registrations. conductor/tests/atlas.test.ts
// asserts the pin in BOTH directions, so a vocabulary member with no node and a
// node claiming a member that does not exist are each a red run. The same
// construction vocab-registry.ts uses for cross-language spelling, applied to the
// shape of the system rather than to its words.
//
// WHAT IS PINNED AND WHAT IS NOT. The NODE SET is derived and enforced. The EDGE
// set and the prose are editorial: no module states the order of the pipeline in
// one place, so a person writes it and a reader checks it. That split is the
// honest one — the drift that actually happens is "a gate was added and the map
// never heard about it", which the pin catches, not a re-drawn arrow.
//
// WHY THIS LIVES IN tools/ AND NOT IN core/. It was written as a core module and
// moved, because a documentation-data module cannot sit in a scanned production
// tree. Four separate text audits read conductor/{core,adapter,plugin} as TEXT,
// and every one of them treats a STRING LITERAL as code — which is exactly what
// this file is made of:
//
//   unreachable-exports  counts identifiers, so naming `fetchMetricsSummary` in
//                        prose lifted that dead symbol out of the unreached set;
//   purity (core-imports) matches `from "…"`, so the phrase "…distinguish a repo
//                        I may not write from 'no repo at all'" parsed as an import;
//   ops-behavioral-anchor greps for a banner emitter, and the caveat SAYING no
//                        module emits a banner registered as one that does;
//   comment-hygiene       applies to the prose either way, and rightly.
//
// Each was survivable alone. Together they make the point: prose describing the
// tree, placed inside the tree, silently disables the audits that keep the tree
// honest. tools/ is still typechecked and still gate-scanned, and the pin in
// conductor/tests/atlas.test.ts is what actually guarantees accuracy — the core
// purity guard never did, because a frozen data literal has no I/O to forbid.
//
// STATUS OF THE CLAIMS. Every node describes what the code at this revision
// SPECIFIES. Task 13.2 (the live smoke) has not been run, so no edge here has
// been observed end to end on a live model. Nodes whose behaviour is known to
// diverge from what a reader would assume carry a `caveat`.

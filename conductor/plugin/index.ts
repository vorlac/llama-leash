// conductor/plugin/index.ts — Task 5.3 (hook bodies; plan lines 2375-2391, §3.5).
// The opencode plugin FACTORY and NOTHING else: the 1.18.15 loader iterates every
// export of a plugin module and throws `TypeError("Plugin export is not a
// function")` when one is not a plugin function — skipping the WHOLE plugin and
// leaving the session ungated (Task 0.2 wire-notes). So this module exports
// exactly `ConductorPlugin`; the shared tool inventory lives in the sibling
// adapter/tools.ts.
//
// The returned hooks are (1) `tool`: the map built from CONDUCTOR_TOOL_NAMES, each
// value a `tool({...})` definition, (2) `tool.execute.before`: a THIN body
// that parses the opencode input and delegates to the ONE adapter function
// gateBeforeToolCall — which returns to allow and THROWS to deny (opencode reads
// the thrown message back to the model as the refusal reason, Task 0.2 wire-notes)
// — and (3) `chat.message`: the equally thin body that delegates to the ONE
// adapter function handleChatMessage, which creates the §3.2 run and writes the
// arriving session's §3.5 orchestrator registry entry (task-let 5.4a).
//
// Construction-safety: the factory only builds closures and zod schemas — no
// blocking I/O and no live opencode service is touched at construction — so the
// tool registration is unit-testable with a synthetic PluginInput and no running
// opencode (gate-wiring.test.ts constructs it and inspects the registered names).
// The workspace is therefore opened LAZILY, on first hook use, against the
// REALPATH of input.directory (§0.2 wire-notes pins canonicalization as a DRIFT:
// opencode canonicalizes session directories, and a non-canonical root makes the
// scope gates silently mis-match). An open that fails is LOUD on the §7.1 stderr
// sink and leaves the gate hook DENYING — a plugin that fails open, or that
// throws at construction and is skipped whole, is the §3.8 silent-ungate case.
//
// THE TWO-PHASE JOURNAL. createJournal is bound to a RUN DIRECTORY; the run
// directory is made by store.createRun(); the store needs a journal to open. That
// cycle is real, and the resolution is ONE journal object whose SINK is
// rebindable: before any run exists it writes through the §7.1 stderr sink, and
// the moment a run directory exists it rebinds to the createJournal-backed JSONL
// sink for that dir. Records written before the rebind are NOT replayed into the
// file — they were correctly stderr-only workspace events, and filing them under
// a run they did not belong to would break replay's source-order guarantee.
//
// G1/§5.1 `tool()` resolution: §1.4's dual-runtime guard treats
// `@opencode-ai/plugin` as a dev dependency, but §5.1 needs the runtime `tool()`
// helper to register custom tools. The installed package resolves this: its `.`
// export re-exports `./tool.js`, whose runtime value `tool` is `(input) => input`
// with `tool.schema` = zod (verified in node_modules and already relied on by the
// Task 0.2 recorder-plugin fixture). opencode loads this plugin under its own
// runtime and resolves the bare specifier from conductor/node_modules; Node
// type-stripping resolves the same path for the test. So the VALUE import below is
// the sanctioned runtime use of the package; the `Plugin`/`PluginInput` names are
// type-only (erased).
